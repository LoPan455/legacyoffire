<p>The party makes sure everyone is healed, then examines the doorway to the central stair. Still listens to the door, hears the plunking of small pebbles falling inside. Valin opens the door then jumps out of the way as a wall of rock falls forward through the opening. It appears some of the central stairway has collapsed and this entrance to the stairs is blocked.</p>

<p>Still sneaks up to look at their rope hanging from the edge of the collapsed area of the top floor, he see those two javelin throwing Trogs that they repelled passed are laying on the ground of the floor above and scanning the lower room from the edge so they can determine if their leader was victorious or dead.  Still creeps back and the party decides they must flee through the front entrance and come back around the temple and climb to the roof again.</p>

<p>Salah uses dancing lights to distract javelin throwing Troglodytes watching from above, and the party makes a break for the door. Everyone except Valin gets through before the Trogs can react to the party, as they are too busy throwing javelins at the dancing lights. One javelin tossed at Valin goes wide and then the party ducks around the corner and is out of range.</p>

<p>Drexel is sent out on camel guard duty while the rest of the party continues the exploration.</p>

<p>They climb back to the top of the building, Still listens to the roof and hears nothing, they then drop through the hole in the roof and make their way down the center stair.</p>


<p>Still listens the sh!t out of all the doors they encounter from here on before having Valin kick it open with weapons drawn (with one exception noted below). They find an ancient armory, which Nobody scans with detect magic to quickly find a magic dagger, a single magic arrow, and a magic nail that appears to be some crude version of a throwing star. They also find some masterwork leather armor and a composite longbow with a +2 strength pull. Through the next door they then find an empty room that looks like it might be a make shift sleeping quarters and then bust open the door behind the two javelin chucking Trogs.</p>

<p>First Trog gets and arrow to the skull that almost brains him, but is deflected by a boney horn (crit not confirmed). Valin then steps up and hits that arrow square with the blade of his ax, and drives ax and arrow all the way out the other side (crit!). Still, Salah, and Boomer move into the room and a couple swings go wide as Salah starts dancing, then Nobody and Valin deliver the same one/two punch to the second Trog, sticking him with an arrow then cutting him down (who the hell invited Carl anyway).  With both Trogs down, the party could have stopped to catch their breath� but there is a door here that is already cracked open and Still and Salah are hungry for battle after watching Valin and nobody take all the glory. Valin, first through every door, gets pushed aside by Still who is immediately clubbed into unconsciousness by the huge Trog barbarian waiting to bean the first adventurer through the door (probably should have listened at that one). Behind this barbarian are 2 more Trogs and what appears to be an unconscious tied up woman.</p>

<p>Another arrow, this time the found magic one, flies true into the barbarian from Nobody, and it explodes with electric energy! It is followed by ax and sword WIFFS! by Valin (about time). It seems the one/two punch is not flawless. Salah spins into the room still in his dance and delivers a whirling dagger strike to the barbarian. But this barbarian is no fool. Surrounded by melee fighters he charges out of the room towards the wizard, delivering a solid club strike� but luckily for Nobody the swing just misses and smacks the ground next to him. Boomer goes to heal Still and Valin, stepping between the barbarian and the wizard, delivers a solid smack with his ax. Salah throws his new magic dagger, and it smack hard into the wall next to the barbarian. Amazingly it floats into the air and begins to return to him. Still sees this awesomeness and decides to throw his newly found magic star. It sticks hard into the barbarians face and explodes with magic energy dropping the barbarian. Arrows and daggers make quick work of one of the two remaining Trogs, and the last one drops his weapons and surrenders.</p>

<p>Boomer goes over to start healing the captive, who turns out to be a beautiful young wizard named Baleena. Nobody translates the Trog�s pleas for his life in dragonic to Still, Salah, and Valin who still stand around him. But mid sentence the Trog makes a strange contorted face and falls to the ground dead, leaking from a puncture wound in his kidney. Still totally has no idea what happened and the party goes to talk with Baleena.</p>

<p>With everyone needing to heal up, boomer does his best but is getting low on spells. They search the barbarian body and find a few potions, a masterworked club, and some gold. Still hands one to Valin that looks kind of like his other cure potions and says �Here, this should totally heal you.� Trusting Valin drinks it down�. Luckily it actually heals him quite a bit.</p>

<p>The Lady Baleena, now fully healed, asks if the party has gone through the rune covered door below. They say they were just heading there. She offers to come with and help the party if she is allowed 8 hours rest to regen spells. She does say that Rayhim will want first dibs on any magical artifacts found on the floor below, but will pay the party handsomely for their help. The party talks it over, agrees to let her go into her trance for study, and then leaves her with Drexel (who they call back in from camel duty) and head downstairs without her.</P>

<p>Down the stairs, the rune covered door is listened to and examined by Still who is quite convinced there could be no traps at all on this door (natural 1) and tells Valin to open it. The runes explode, filling the stairwell with fire. Everyone heals up a bit with potions then then head inside.</p>

<p>Inside they see a temple, the walls are covered with decaying tapestries depicting images of the Nethys, god of magic. There is an alter in front of them in a room mostly decorated with white, to symbolize the good aspect of magic. Around the corner is a very black room with another alter, symbolizing the dark magic aspect of Nethys. Just inside the door is the charred remains of a Troglodyte. Heading toward the white alter, Valin stops in his tracks as two skeletons on the ground rise up. They have swords in their hand and their boney bodies ignite bathing them in flames.</p>

<p>Nobody fires force missiles at them from a scroll. Still moves in and slashes wide, and Salah starts his dance. Then Valin charges. Continuing the one/two punch he swings his ax into the creature. It tries to block with its boney arm but the ax cleaves through arm, ribs, and spine (another crit!). The skeleton collapses into a pile of bones and Valin scoffs at the minor burning sensation he feels on his ax arm as he makes the kill. The remaining skeleton unleashes a torrent of flaming claws at Still� but Still nimbly dodges all the attacks. Nobody fires and arrow but misses. Still, having had enough of Valin taking all the kills and maybe reminded of his skills by the quiet death of the cowering Trog upstairs, takes his elven curve blade and cleaves down on the skeletons head. The blade passes through its skull and into its collar bone, and the skeleton drops like a rock (another crit!). The flames go out and the party goes in to inspect the alters.</p>

<p>On each alter they find a spell book and two scrolls. The spell books contain spells that are too high of a level to be useful to Nobody, but their ancient origin no doubt would make them a good find for a high level wizard. The party grabs up the scrolls (2 communal energy resistance, 2 fireball) and stuffs them in Nobody�s pack. They then grab the books and head back upstairs.</p>

<p>They wake Baleena and tell her the job is done, handing her the books. Surprised, she goes downstairs to take note of the tapestries then they all decide to make haste back to Katapesh before some other party comes to claim their prize. As dawn breaks, the party plus Baleena is riding through �Dawn Gate� in Katapesh and are met by Rayhim�s party that was heading out to explore the temple. They are escorted back to Rayhim�s estate and enjoy his hospitality for the morning as he reviews their findings. He rewards the party handsomely and expresses his gratitude for the rescue of his student Baleena.</p>

<p>If they ever have need of his services to identify any artifacts or seek information about other dimensions or planes of existence, he would be happy to oblige. (FORESHADOW)</p>
