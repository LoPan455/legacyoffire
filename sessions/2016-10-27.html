<h2>LoF 9 - 10-27-2016 <br>Keeping What's Yours and the Roll in of the Wrecking Crew</h2>

<p>After some discussion of scouting out the east buildings the next night, the party finally lays down for rest after a long day. In the pre-dawn light, the party is awakened by a braying howl. Looking out across the pesh field to Kelmarene, they see a lone Gnoll standing on the roof of the battle market, facing towards pale mountain in the distance. Its head is bent down toward the earth, howling an eerie hyena like howl. Sallah’s familiarity with languages tells the group that it is some sort of all clear call. Soon a similar howl can be heard further up into the peaks, in the area of the old fort, then a another reposnse even further off out in the brazen peaks, then a another, and another, and another. The Gnoll atop the battle market starts braying again, making it hard to count the exact number of responces, but there are many echoing off the peaks. Drexel, with his gnoll knowledge, can tell the call is being sent to some sort of pack master, but doesn’t know who. Almah mentions that the same calls were heard 10 days ago when they were just arriving in the area. Dashki steps from the shadows of the hall, peering off at the distant mountain…. “It is the call of the carrion king.” He says, the words dripping with disgust.</p>

<p>Sallah pipes in. He adds that he has heard of this carrion king. Huge gnoll, very strong. They say he was the first gnoll to start worshiping Rovagug instead of Lamashtu. He has been growing in power these past decades. Dashki adds that the carrion king gains power not because of his worship of Rovagug, but because he has unlocked the power of making the unchosen. Surgically altered gnolls who grow to an immense size and strength.</p>

<p>Sallah listens to the braying for a bit longer, his is a little more at ease when he can tell that all of the calls are coming from the mountains in front of them, and there are none from the desert behind. It is about this time that people realize that Still is not here. Sallah brushes that off, says that Still told him that he was going to go do some scouting and that he would meet up with the team later. The braying stops, and everyone goes back to sleep. They plan to rest till noon or 1 and then head toward Kelmarene at sundown. </p>

<p>Noon comes, everyone wakes up, and there is still no Still. Almah gets a bit nervous about the plan. She urges that the party head to the church first, because if Still is scouting the east buildings we could spring the trap to early. The party begrudgingly agrees that they will hit the church first, and if all goes well circle wide around town and come in towards the east buildings closer to dawn. The Sand lions will go with them to the church but hang back, so that they can rush in if needed and Cubby can shoot a signal into the air if an all out assault starts. Nobody and Ackbar decide to head to the east side of town and hang way back, and Nobody will give the signal if an all out attack starts on that end of town.</p>

<p>Planning is interrupted when Fatah, who is on watch, calls everyone to the open hall. See peeks around the wall and looks to the sky pointing. Everyone takes a peak. High above the monastery it appears a very large bird is circling. Breifly, the party thinks the harpy has spotted them, but as the bird lowers they see it is too big to be a harpy and it looks vulture like. Suddenly it dawns on them. Mama has come home for her eggs! Everyone rushes to the open courtyard border and hides by an entry waiting for it to land. They instruct Kazzim to try to get a hold of the bird so that if it is wounded it won’t fly away and give up their location. It would be better if it never leaves. The bird land and the trap is sprung. The fight goes quickly with so many swords, axes, steel balls, fists and arrows coming at it from all directions. Drexel finishes it off with an arrow in the mouth as it starts to screech.  The party waits for night fall.</p>

<p>With the help of the lions dark vision and Drexels low light eyes, the party approaches the church from the west creeping low up a hillside that appears to be capped by crumbling pillars. Most of the lions hang back as planned, but the party decides to take the monk twins with them since they are the quietest of the bunch. AS they crest the hill, they see that the pillars are the outer ring of an old graveyard. Beyond the graveyard a domed cathedral of Adbar looms large.  The thick wood doors are broken, bits still hanging from the hinges and beyond them is a short hallway leading to the cathedrals dark interior. In the center of the graveyard there is a large statue of Adbar, his hands raised and facing toward the city in a welcoming gesture. In front of the statue, a man kneels in the dirt paying homage to the god of cities.</p>

<p>The party approaches cautiously with weapons drawn. As they get near the man, still kneeling in front of the statue, says “Welcome travelers…” His head turns toward the party revealing the grotesque skeletal visage… “to my church.” (cue creepy music for Halloween session).</p>

<p>The party rushes in weapons swinging and quickly surround the creature and start whailing. Each blow of ax, sword, and meteor hammer crunches bone or clangs off his breastplate. Drexels arrows fly true and start to line the creatures spine like acupuncture needles. He takes a swing at Valan, his pole arm draws blood, but it is merely a flesh wound. Zombies start to emerge from the 5 graves in front of the statue, but the wrecking crew is unfazed. An arrow flies in a knocks a neck vertebrae askew (crit!), and Valin uses the new tilt of the head to smack that skull out of the park with his ax. The Zombies are all beheaded before they even take their first steps. The party loots the body and heads into the church.</p>

<p>Inside is a real horror show. The walls of the church are soot covered from a large fire and corpses are everywhere. Taking in the scene, the party can tell that some of them were clerics of adbar, and some were just ordinary citizens with pitch forks and shovels. It appears that they fought a battle here against soldiers, who have also left their dead among the pile of corpses. The soldiers all wear the red metal of the pact master guard.</p>

<p>After a quick scan for magic (there is none) the party moves through the catherdral to the only other exit of the room, a stairway leading down behind the alter is cast in a dull red glow. At the bottom of the stairs, a reinforced stout oak door has a strange fist sized rune etched at its center. The rune is not the symbol of adbar or the div or any symbol the party can recognize. It radiates strong magic and glows with a deep red light. The party backs away and Sallah tries open/close on the door. It has no effect. They decide they have done enough here for now and leave the same way they came continuing with the wrap around plan to the east building, leaving Cubby, Hammad, and Kazzim to watch the church from a safe distance till dawn.</p>

<p>Coming wide around the city to the east side, they meet up with Akbar and Nobody. There is still no sign of still and the 2 buildings east of the river have been quiet all night. Smoke still rises from the one and the flying creature left at night fall and headed into the battle market and then did its areal patrol and went back to the battle market as normal. Still no sign of Still. Ther party decides not to wait any longer, and the then creep in on the harpy building.</p>

<p>As they get up close they peer in the windows, there is nothing inside but hay.. as if an animal has been sleeping in the building. They come around front to sneak in, and that’s when they hear the song. It’s coming from the building with the smoke rising from it, which is exactly where Sallah is heading because he has been captivated!!! The party turns and draws as the harpy walks form the door and takes to the air above the building. Sallah starts walking her way as Valin and Drexel pull bows and start firing. The arrows are very effective. The two monks try the grab a hold of Sallah to stop him, and one succeeds by getting his attention and flashing him. The harpy drops back down into the building, not wanting to take any more arrow fire. Valin rushes up and tries the window shutters…. Locked. Drexel rushes around the other side of the building. He makes the door just as Valin smashed through the shutter on the other side with his ax. One of the monks rushes into the room and straight punches the harpy in her jaw. Drexel plugs her with another arrow. She stops singing, and holds up her hands. “Wait” she says…. “I can help y..” Her sentence is cut short as she looks down at the ax head that just erupted from her chest. Valin made it through the window. </p>

<p>She falls to the ground and looks up at Valin…”You were beautiful” she whispers and she reaches up to Valin’s face as she dies.</p>
