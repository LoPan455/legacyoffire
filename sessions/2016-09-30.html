<h2>9/30/2016 -<br>The Caster Biotch Fight and Enter the Hamster Cat</h2>

<p>As the looting of the body of this Djann wraps up, Nobody rushes back to the decrepid floating barge, still thinking it’s his luxury yacht. Akbar is also still confused and he rushes back up there as well. This pisses Nobody off something fierce, and will yells of “Get off my boat!” he blasts Akbar with a  force missle. This starts the repeat loop of confused attacks between the two casters, as Akbar shoves Nobody off, and Nobody reponds with a lightning bolt from his new staff. From there it is nothing but lightning from both sides while the others start to shout “Kumite, Kumit…”. Boomer moves in to cure whomever drops first. Meanwhile, Valin is still over by the body and the statue near him starts talking to him. It says random stuff like “Who holds the power” and “Whom do you serve”. The other statue chimes in too, and he and Sallah notice that the mist that is confusing the casters is coming from the statues mouths. Sallah tries smashing a statue, but the cracks he makes start to bleed mist so he decides that’s a bad idea. Valin rips the cloak off the dead Djann and comes up with his now patented shove and plug move. Meanwhile, Nobody has won the Kumite and Boomer has stabilized Akbar. Drexel has moved in and he starts harshing on the side of Nobody’s head with the flat of his blade. He gets a lightning bolt or 2 for his trouble (Nobody is a pro at the old duck and weave), but eventually hard steel prevails and Nobody is unconscious as well.
</p>
 
<p>Drexel and Valin start dragging the Djann body, Valin, and Akbar out of the mist cave and back to the last cleared room they were in. Boomer explains that the mist is affecting them like a poison and once they aren’t breathing it they should be ok. Meanwhile, Sallah is still looking into the statues, and has noticed that every once in a while they seem to talk in the voice of the dead Djann and say things like “Power of wish revoked” and Davashunne betrayor”. Something more is going on here. Meanwhile, a hamster sized Persian cat has crawled out of the small hole at the top of the staff Nobody had taken off the dead Djann. It starts floating around like it was picked up by the scruff of its neck by an invisible hand, and it picks up the staff and floats toward the room the rest of the bodies have been taken. Boomer and Sallah were going to go investigate this, but the statues talk in the Djanns voice again. This time they say “Ahriman seeks wish abuse.” And “DIVS… SHILED YOUR EYES!!!”. After that, Sallah spots what looks like a cloaked humanoid figure approaching through the mist.
</p>
 
<p>The minicat has taken the staff and put in on Nobody’s unconscious body. Valin and Drexel move back into the mist room as the cloaked figure gets closer. Sallah tries to talk to it, as it gets close enough to be seen through the mist the party sees it is a horrible creature with nasty claws and a single evil eye surrounded by fangs. Sallah immediately recognizes it as a div and warns the party of its resistances and DR. Then he remembers the gaze attack… TO LATE! The evil eye stuns Sallah and he drops his weapon. Boomer also succumbs to the stunning gaze.
</p>
 
<p>Drexel is far enough away that the mist is blocking the gaze attack, and through the concealment of the mist he manages to start getting arrow shots off at the thing drawing first blood. Valin’s toughness fights off the stunning feeling, and he rushes up to start swinging ax and sword at the beast. It staggers back from his attacks and tries to affect his mind with a spell, but Valin shakes that off as well and presses the attack. Sallah and boomer remain stunned and more arrows fly, one looking to go right into the fang covered eye but the mist can be deceiving and the shot goes wide (crit missed due to concealment). The thing steps back again to try to cast a spell, and again fails. But this step put boomer out range of the gaze. Coming to, he covers his eyes and runs up to shield Sallah’s eyes with his shield. Sallah comes to and picks up his ball and chain. Drexel fires again, and this time the mist does not deceive him. The arrow goes right into the eye of the beast and he wails in pain. Still the gaze goes on though, and finally Valin succumbs to the creatures will. It jumps at the opportunity to full attack a stunned Valin, and claws him viciously. Sallah’s meteor hammer flies in , but goes wide. Then, Valin comes to, dodges and AOO as he picks up his ax, and brings it down on the evil eye splattering it into goo.
</p>
 
<p>At this point everyone retreats into the cathedral chamber and heals up. Akbar and Nobody are now ok, and Boomer uses his speak with animals spell to talk to the little hamster cat. They find out the dead Djann was Dunyizad, one of the Templars. She had come here to warn Vardishai about some sort of betrayal by the Djann Davashunn and to find her successor. The tiny cats name is Mooshqit, and it was Dunyizad’s familiar… but now it will serve Nobody. The cat doesn’t know a ton, because it can’t speak common and could only learn what it saw or what Dunyizad told it directly.
</p>
 
<p>After healing up the party moves through the statue hallway again. Sallah and Akbar are intrigued by the messages from Dunyizad that are coming through the statues. So they pass through the hallway many times until they are sure they have heard them all. Meanwhile, the rest of the party moves through a ruined scroll library and into a small room with a wooden sphinx it is that appears to have once been animated but is now just a statue. In this room, they are attacked by choakers. Valin makes quick work of the first one, and Nobody and Drexel blast the second one off the ceiling. The third one manages to get a hold of Valin’s neck, but is splattered by the rest of the crew before it can do any real damage. During the fight, Boomer pulls out a crossbow to show off how bad he is at using weapons, and Akbar is still distracted by the statues (and smoking) and right before the last choaker is killed the party hears him yelling from the next room over “Hey guys, I’m in the room!”
</p>
 
<p>During their hallway runs, Sallah and Akbar heard the following:</p>
 
<p>“Power of wish revoked”</p>
<p>“Templars divided”</p>
<p>“Davashunn betrayor!”</p>
<p>“Seeking kakishone”</p>
<p>“Creeper found spooky… Astral projection”</p>
<p>“Helping Efreets”</p>
<p>“Warn Vardishai”</p>
<p>“Mist confusion lycanthropy…. Lost control”</p>
<p>“Ahriman seeks wish abuse”</p>
<p>“DIVS… SHIELD YOUR EYES!”</p>
 
<p>After clearing out this last room, the party heads upstairs and settles into a spot where they can look down on kelemerene, and they watch it for a few hours and eat some lunch and listen to a story about kakishone told by Sallah (see attached). They spot 2 locations where it looks like Gnolls are stationed watching the city, and see smoke coming from the chimney of one of the 2 buildings on the shrine side of the river. They ten see a party of 4 gnolls drag what looks to be a humanoid prisoner (someone they didn’t recognize and not from Almah’s party) get dragged out in front of the battel market and get eviscerated by cackling gnolls, who leave the body there and then go back inside.</p>
