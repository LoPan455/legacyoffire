<h2>LoF 11 - 11/21/2016 <br> The Burnanating and Death of a Goat Thing</h2>

<p>Still rolls in invisibly and lights the bridge up. All the gnoll archers on the bridge die and the big tower shield guys seem unhappy as everyone else gets some buffs going and starting working their way forward. Gnolls appear in many windows and arrows start coming from all over. Drexel ineffectively returns fire into windows as Valin and Sallah work their way forward to support Still and they all start swinging at bridge dudes. The bridge dudes are tough and they stand firm. Boomer continues to move in as fast as his little legs will take him and Akbar does some magic that isn’t effective. The bridge dudes throw javelins at Valin, they all bounce off his shiny breastplate. The guy closest to him draws and ax and takes a chunk. He is followed by a rain of arrows from the nearby buildings and Valin’s luck runs out. He’s down and bleeding out. Sallah trips the ax dude and dances through to the other side of the bridge to set a flank up.</p>

<p>Boomer gets to the bridge and he and Akbar get to healing while Still uses the flank from Sallah to take the tripped dude out. At this point Still notices other gnolls watching from around the corner of a few buildings. They seem to be waiting for something. Drexel continues his poor display of archery, but does manage to get a little bop in here and there. Valin is up, and he stands and starts swinging at the next front man with Sallah and Still, but the tower shield is hard to penetrate. The goat demon appears and is running fast toward the bridge. All the gnolls except the one in melee get out of his way. The melee fighter takes a last wild swing at Valin… it’s a crit! Valin eats dirt again and boomer continues to heal as Akbar puts up a bunch of cloud cover to protect the party from all the archers in the windows. Drexel moves into position to have a clear shot at the demon as everyone starts contemplating retreat. The demon charges in a Sallah, but he misses. Sallah connects with a swing for a bit of damage. Drexels arrows fly in, but they can’t get through the DR. Valin is back on his feet, and he takes a bite out of the demon with his ax as boomer keeps the heals coming and akbar puts up a second smoke screen. Everyone starts to try to draw the demon back, but Sallah can’t move because of his attack. The demon comes at him again… and misses again!</p>

<p>With the screen up the arrow fire has halted, Drexel can’t do anything with his arrows and more gnolls have shown up at the end of the street. There is a lot of debate about running while they can, but the finish the job we came here for crew led by the call for action from boomer wins through. Still warps himself behind the demon and gets a sneak attack off with the aid of Sallah’s chain. His strange eastern blade cuts deep into the demons exposed flank and foul smelling ichor sprays out (almost all 6s on a lot of six siders, incredible roll). The demon is destroyed!!!! (and the body vanishes like destroyed summon demons are known to do).</p>

<p>The gnolls are pissed. They let out the war pigs and a gnoll comes around a corner with a pack of hyena’s on leashes! The pigs charge in and the front one connects for some painful goring. The party starts a fighting retreat. Arrows from Drexel seem better equipped to stick pigs, and Valin’s as and sword find pig flesh soft and squishy. The party manages to drop one the the pigs before fading into the brush to run.</p>

<p>The pigs and hyenas give chase for a bit, but eventually are called back. The party makes it back to camp to rest and tell their tale.</p>

<p>Just before dawn, a group of gnolls are seen approaching the monastery from the direction of the temple. Everyone gets into defensive positions and ready for a fight, but suddenly Dashki jumps in front of everyone waiving his hands and telling the party not to attack. He says it is Gnolls of the three jaw clan, and they are here to help.</p>
