<h2>7/11/2016</h2>

<p>After arriving into port on a ship from Absalom Boomer the gnome cleric convinces his new best friends to accompany him to Jerikal's ales for a drink. Having nothing better to do, Still the Elf Ninja, Nobody the Elf Wizard, and Valin the Human Ranger decide to tail along. During the journey Boomer had been quite instant that the 3 non-merchant looking dudes on the boat become friends with him even though Still kind of just stood around silently Valin did not partake in the alcohol. Nobody and Boomer were quickly becoming friends do to their shared love of Lizards (which they both have) and a love of all things narcotic.</p>

<p>Unbeknownst to the 4 new arrivals, Sallah of the fraternal order of dervishes had just overheard that an ancient temple or fortress of unknown origian was just unveiled by the shifting sands about 6 hours north of town. He quickly got a hold of some horses and camels and went to Jerikal�s looking for adventuring companions who would be willing to leave with him immediately to beat any other would be explorers to the site. He quickly spotted Drexel the Half Elf ranger, and knowing the dark skinned elf is always up for hunting evil creatures he quickly got his on and off business contact onto the mission. They looked about the room trying to find others to approach. Seeing a party with a brooding elf and a muscle bound human both armed to the teeth hanging out with a drunk gnome and an elf who looked to be a wizard, they figured they found their mark.</p>

<p>They approached and quickly realized the gnome was drunk as a skunk, but they convinced the other 3 to come adventure with them. The Elves were easy enough to convince, but Sallah found that Valin was looking for his brother, and Sallah had to make promises that he would help locate them as soon as they return. Nobody, not wanting to leave his new best friend behind, convinced the cleric to come drink on a camel (cause the probably hasn�t before) and Boomer decided to join in on the journey with intention of watching over the mounts while the party explores.</p>

<p>A quick, uneventful journey through the desert brought them to a tilted domed structure half exposed in the side of a sand dune. The front had a large door and a broken out 15ft diameter window. The side walls showed signs of wear, with large chucks of stone missing in various locations, but the white dome appeared to be marble or some other tough stone and in fairly good shape. Circling around the structure, someone spotted a hole that had been broken in the top of the dome. It was quickly decided that checking in the roof would be the first move, and Still was sent up to quietly scope it out.</p>

<p>Inside he saw a Lizard like humanoid (troglodyte) and a horse sized horned lizard crackling with electric energy. He tried to sign back to his friends, but they didn't totally understand. The rest of the party decided to climb up and join him, but of course the clunky climbing of Valin brought the attention of the creatures in the room. Nobody and Drexel began hammering away at the shock lizard with their bows as Still dropped a rope down and rappelled into the room, being followed closely by Sallah and Valin. The shock lizard did what shock lizards do, and it hurt. The troglodyte was a druid, and put out a flaming sphere and started summoning something. Once down, the bowmen continued to work the lizard from the roof as the 3 inside rushed at the troglodyte. Nobody managed to get a perfect shot through the lizards eye and put it down, but the 3 on the ground were finding the humanoid hard to hit. To make matters worse, as Valin rushed in to take his first swing at the floor beneath everyone collapsed under his weight� at least that summoning spell was interrupted : )</p>

<p>The troglodyte and Valin dropped 60 ft to the stone floor below as Still and Sallah jumped back to safety. Valin was unconscious, maybe dead. Nobody and Drexel quickly dropped into the room as Still set up a second line to get down to Valin. At about that time Boomer dropped in from the roof to give everyone a channel and made his way up to the ledge to help. AS they watched from above, they saw a web shoot out from somewhere and coat Valin, and the troglodyte stood up and ran for the cover of the back of the room� they better hurry. Sallah went first to try to get to Valin and heal him. As he dropped down, more troglodytes on the floors below stepped up to the ledge and began throwing javalins. Still was next down the line followed by boomer, Drexel, and a hesitant Nobody who would have preferred to stay up top and wait for a target.</p>

<p>Once on the ground, Sallah and Boomer got Valin up on his feet. Still and Sallah went after the troglodyte as Drexel and Nobody worked on the new giant spider threat. It was touch and go for a bit, with Still going unconscious at one point as well and the troglodyte continuing to be difficult to hit� but the party managed to finally put him down and clear the first floor. The troglodytes in the middle floor unable to throw javelins at them as long at they stay away from the hole in the ceiling, the new party then finally stopped to catch their breath.</p>
