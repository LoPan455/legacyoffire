<h2>LoF 8 - 10/17/2016<br>The Scoutening and Rescue of the Nag</h2>

<p>The party sent Valin back to camp to let Almah know they were going to loop around the north end of Kelmarene and check out the city after nightfall. They wouldn’t get a good view or be able to help the Lions of Fatar as they entered the pesh field, but they figured they would get a good look at what happens in the city when they attacked, and see the city up close after sunset.
</p>
 <p>The trip was uneventful, except for noting that Gnolls have been coming and going along the river north of the city every few days. The party suspects there is communication happening between the town and the old fort up north.
 </p>
 <p>From their vantage point above the city to the north, the party noted that there was another guard post on top of a building on the west side of the battle market. They also saw a patrol of about 8 gnolls moving around the streets of the city. Not much more was spotted until nightfall.  At dusk, a small sized flying creature came out of a building on the east bank of the river. It circled the town a few times, then crawled into an upper window of the battle market. After a few minutes, it crawled back out and went to sit on the battle market roof. The gnoll patrol moved into one of the buildings that had a watch above it, and a fresh patrol unit came out to take their place. Still no one had touched the eviscerated body, which Drexel found odd because usually the gnoll would eat a victim like that.</p>
 
 <p>As darkness settled over the city, a second patrol of 8 gnolls left the battle market. This patrol appeared to be thoroughly looking in the abandoned buildings, as if they were looking for someone. Lastly, a large creature emerged from a building to the south, let out an unnerving bleating screech, when up and ate the eviscerated body, then started walking the streets.</p>
 
 <p>After all this watching, one other thing they noted is that all the patrols seem to avoid the old church on the west side of town.</p>
 
 <p>The party thought long and hard about moving in on the building the flying creature had come out of, to ambush it when it returned home in the morning. But ultimately, they decided they couldn’t move in without Boomer having his spells and without Almah and her crew knowing what they were doing. So they retreated back the way they had came to the temple, and from there back to the monastery to report in with Almah.</p>
 
 <p>Upon arriving at camp it was still night time. Valin emerged from Almah’s quarters and explained he couldn’t get his curse lifted till morning. The Sand Lions were there drinking, celebrating their victory over a large burrowing creature in the pesh field that the party identified from the description as a dust digger. It had tried to swallow Kazzim, which was a mistake. Kazzim had brought the creature tongue back to camp as proof. The party brought Almah and Garavel to gether with the sand lions and started discussing their plans to infiltrate the buildings on the east side of the river or maybe the church. The party was split on whether or not the church holds something horrible that the gnolls are avoiding, or something that could help them against these evil creatures.</p>
 
<p>About that time, Sarah (one of the sand lions) who had been on watch alerted the group that there was motion in the pesh field. It appeared that a patrol of gnolls had entered the field to see what had been going on out there (having spotted the commotion of the sand lions battle earlier in the night). They were prodding a humanoid captive about 20ft in front of the them as they moved through the field. The party decided to go take the patrol out, and the and lions were going to go too…. But Almah said the lions needed to stay put in case the party got captured. They settled on just taking Fatah with them to show them where the dust diggers corpse is at so they could set up an ambush.</p>
 
<p>Tey found the corpse, covered it in a fog cloud, and put dancing lights in it. Everyone except Still and Drexel hid in the fog cloud, with still and Drexel crouching in the pesh 50 ft back to come up behind the gnoll party. Although not seen, things went a little south when a gnoll randomly almost stepped on Drexel in his hiding spot. The 3 gnoll fighters, their leader, and the old gnome woman prisoner were caught in the pinch, but the 4 gnoll archers had Drexel and Still at close range.</p>
 
 
<p>A fight broke out, with Drexel’s first shots going wide. Still popped up out of nowhere and took an archer’s trachea out then disappeared. Valin charged out of the mist toward the leader, but the leader responded with an ax swipe that almost brained Valin through his helmet. Boomer started moving around his lights to get everyone the sight they needed, and made it look like a crazy orc to unaffectedly try to draw fire or scare some dudes off. Valin raged out and started slowly working the leader. She was hard to hit but Valin was making progress. Gnolls started coming at Drexel from all directions, getting up in his face with axes making it hard for him to get a shot off without opening him up to attacks. He stuck with his bow, hoping to dodge all the axes coming at him and take gnolls out quickly. The first arrow bounced off a breastplate, but the second went in through the eye of the gnoll standing next to him and left through the back of the skull dragging brains with it. Akbar got the gnoll leader to drop her ax, and Valin kept up the assault. The b!tch responded with claws and teeth, putting Valin dangerously close to unconsciousness. But the enraged ranger would not back down and his sword and ax kept coming, finally hacking the leader down. Still continued to work his way through to archers, trying to get to Drexel. His curved blades found blood at every turn, but without the sneak damage the work took longer than he wanted. Drexel was again surrounded. He got another round of arrows off, but this time he couldn’t drop a gnoll. The axes came down on him from 2 direction and Drexel fell to the ground bleeding out.</p>
 
<p>Quickly, Boomer rushed forward and stabilized him as Akbar shifted attention to the ones surrounding Drexel, making their weapons burn in their hands. Fatah danced around the battle, but was having a hard time connecting with her fists and she seemed distracted and kept forgetting to attack : ) With only 2 gnolls left, Valin un-raged and focused on healing himself as still stepped in to cut down the gnoll with the burnt hands. Only one gnoll was left, and for a second it stood their with its ax staring still down…. But ultimately it decided to break and run. Still gave chase, pausing to hit the creature with a cloud of poison that froze it in place of a second. Boomer rushed over to start healing Drexel as Still drew blood from the last gnoll but failed to gut the thing before it started running again. Still continued to give chase and threw stars at it, but they went wide. Valin pulled a bow and took a shot, but the moving target proved difficult to hit. Boomer had finally gotten Drexel conscious. The gnoll hunter jumped to his feet and immediately launched an arrow that tool the last gnoll in the back of the neck.</p>
 
<p>Quickly the party gathered the gnolls loot and untied the gnome prisoner. Boomer cautioned against ungagging her, climbing all old gnoll women do is nag nag nag. The old woman looked skeptically at the group who had saved her. The unbound her and removed her gag and immediately she came forth with questions about who they were and where they came from. Boomer said he tried to warn them. Akbar introduced himself, and the gnome woman said she had a message for him. The captain of the sunset ship, which had brought her and her party over from Absolom, had asked her that if she ever ran into a man named Akbar matching his description to just let him and his brother know that she is alive and doing well. Deciding this is no place to talk, Still helps the woman up so they can get going. The woman smacks his hand away explaining that she can walk. Boomer rolls his eyes as still gives her a surprised and harsh look. She says her name is Yoxferd, but she is tight lipped about any further information until she meets Almah.</p>
 
<p>Once she no longer feels that her situation may have gone from bad to worse, Yoxferd opens up. She explains that she was with a party of pathfinders who had come here to investigate the abandond church of Sarenrae (that the party is now camping in). They too had found the corrupt holy symbols of Adbar here, and determined that the church of Adbar in Kelmarene must have had something to do with it. As they approached town, they saw no sight of the gnolls until it was to late. The gnolls ambushed them, and their cleric was the first to fall. Her party would have been able to fight free, but one of the gnolls blew a horn and a large goat like demon came running to join the fight. The creature swung a visious halberd and cut their wizard in two. It appears to have an affinity for killing casters. The gnolls managed to thake the remaining 4 of them alive. This included their fighter, which was recently eviscerated outside the battle market, their bard Felliped who escaped a few days ago and was supposed to go get help, and their guide… a eukage elf woman named Angelie. To this, Drexel’s pointed ears perk up. This woman is his cousin, she is supposedly hot and very good with her swords.</p>
 
<p>Yoxferd explains that she is a alchemist, specializing in the making of bombs. She has been captive for a few weeks. She assumes Angalie is still ok because she as of yet has not been bested on the battle stage in the market. The party asks about the flying creature. The only one Yoxferd has seen is a Harpy who hangs around with the gnoll leader now and then. She doesn’t know whats in the church, her party was taken out before they go there. There are other non-gnolls in the market too. Human who were allowed to come in and set up shop. She doesn’t know how they got in without being attacked, but it appears the gnoll leader does want trade business to be established in the market. Their leader is not a gnoll thought. He is a Djann with a wicked bow that the gnolls call Carjain.</p>
 
<p>With that, Yoxferd says she will do all she can to help kill these gnolls who murdered her companions. She is shown to the alchemical lab and she gets to work making items from what little material there is there. The party settles in to plan their attack.</p>
