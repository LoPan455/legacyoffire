<h2>8/8/2016</h2>

<p>As the last pugwampi fell, Deshki was quick to gather up one of the corpses. He cackled to himself as he tied its tiny corpse to his walking stick. "You see! You all see! Dashki no lie! Here is proof. Proof! hehehe" Still notices Dashki slyly checking the pockets of the little creature and pocketing the coins for himself, but decides this filthy "man" is not worth slicing up... yet. The party checks over the rest of the pugwampus corpses, and finds a few scattered coins and a few of the late camp seer's harrow cards, further proof that these things were responsible for the fire. The matter settled, and the one that ran off yelling for this "King Mokknock" long gone into the night, they head back to camp with Rupert the goat in tow. </p>

<p>The Sand Lions and the Goat Herder, Cook, and Cleric are all by the fire eating, the Sand Lions again hitting the cups. The party all makes a b-line for Almah's tent. They are stopped before they get there by Hadrah and Sarah, the goat herder and the cook. Hadrah is almost in tears he is so happy to see Rupert returned. He kisses Akbar on the cheeks wishing him a thousand blessings and calling all of the party great men. Sarah gives them all hugs and promises double meat and mead in their servings. Thanking them respectfully, and with a nod from the two Pact Guards at the tent door, the party heads into Almah's tent. Garavel and Almah are inside reviewing a map and talking. As the party enters they stand to greet them, and Dashki immediately waves his pugwampus corpse in their faces triumphantly. "You see! Pugwampus. Dashki is truth! No lies, you trust Dashki you should! hehhehehe" The party explains what they encountered and shows Almah the harrow cards. Garavel pays them the 100gp promised for the investigation, but when Sallah asks for bounty on the pugwampis Garavel explains that there are no ears as proof so he will not pay. The party shrugs it off and they are told to rest and eat this night and the next step will be discussed in the morning.</p>

<p>Still goes off to speak with the camp cleric Father Zastoran about getting his wounds healed. He is taken to the fathers caravan wagon and told to sit on a table. The wagon is full of strange alchemical contraptions and ointments. Father Zastoran casts a cure spell on him and rubs strange smelling balms on his wounds and bandages them, all the while lecturing Still about how he should be more careful and that all this healing does cost resources. The father makes a tally on a sheet. Still asks the father what he knows about poisons, the father tells him he knows enough to know that everyone should avoid them at all costs. The people trying to employ the vile stuff are usually the ones who get poisoned. Sick of this lecture, Still quietly stand and leaves without another word.</p>

<p>Back at the fire, Boomer and Nobody are experimenting with pesh while Akbar takes in the scene and just listens to get to know the sand lions a bit better. He gathers that Hammod the Grim, the smaller of the two large male half orcs, is the leader he is very full of pride and honors tradition above all else. The vary large male with the very big sword goes by the name Kazeem, and he doesn't say much. He just seems to grunt and point at things. Akbar learns later from Sallah that Kazeem's tongue was cut out by gnolls, but he is dense anyway so he would never have had a chance to lead the pack. Besides, Hammod apparently has the strongest bloodline and is the closest connected with the traditions. The two female monks look much more human than the two males, and appear to be related... maybe even twins. They are called Fata and Sasha. The halfling appears to barely have any orc blood in him at all, and everyone calls him Cubby. He appears to be an arcane caster of some sort and "Cubby" appears to be a nickname, perhaps one he isn't to fond of but has gotten used to, most likely related to his small stature among the Sand Lions. It appears that Sallah has had some drinks and has cozied up with the Sand sisters. They seem to be getting along very well. They seem to point at Still and ask some questions, Still remains his stoic self and Sallah sees to distract them with other stories as he leads them away from the fire. Akbar realizes that Valin is nowhere to be seen, figures he may have snuck off to go see if he can get a private audience with Almah. Dashki is still at the fire. He eats ravenously, taking everything he is offered and everything no one else wants. When asked he says that you should always eat as much as possible when food is available because you never know when you will next get a meal. The rest of the night passes without issue.</p>

<p>In the morning, Almah gathers everyone in the camp. She passes around a crude map and explains that the fire and attack last night has made their camp at the sultans claw to vulnerable. There is an abandoned monastery, once a holy place of some saint of Sarenrae, that lies a mile north through the hills. IF it can be cleared out, it would be a defensible location to set up camp and start excursions into Kelmarene. Someone asks about the saints name, Almah says it was Saint Vardishai. Akbar feels a strange sense of dejavu when he hears that name. With that information, Akbar goes into a strange trance for a few minutes. When he snaps out of it, he appears to know everything about Saint Vardishai, his membership in the Templars of the Seven Winds, who each of the other 6 Templars were and what famous weapons they used, their relation to the Djinn Nefeshti and the groups general mission to oppose the god of destruction Rovogug (see coming attachment).  All that information spewed forth, the party gets back to the task at hand.</p>

<p>They ask briefly about he other structures on the map. All she knows about the shrine is that it had something to do with some god of magic. The fort, she explains, is most likely heavily guarded by gnolls, because it guards the pass to Pale Mountain and White Canyon, both known Gnoll territories. She is asked again why Kelmarene was abandoned, she says no one really knows, but whatever happened the Pact Masters turned away from it, leaving it to its fate. She seems a bit sad about that. She says she was very young when it fell, and she was taken from their by her Aunt. She believes her parents died there. When the Pact Masters decided they needed it in their fold again, Almah was not going to pass on the opportunity. Akbar goes into another strange trance. This time, when he pops out of it he says he heard rumors it had something to do with Daemons. Almah does seem to react to that, but she keeps her cool demeanor and says that those are just old wives tale, just like the tales of the undead or the plague or any other such fancy.</p>

<p>Back to the task at hand, Almah explains the monastery is to be taken without drawing a lot of attention, so the party is chosen to take go in first. Hammod is very upset at this and the voices his opinions bout it loudly. Almah says that the Sand Lions tactics would draw to much attention and likly leave the place in ruins anyway, so the lions are to be the fallback. They are to loop wide around the monastery and watch the path between there and Kelmarene, ensuring no information of the attack makes it back to the city. Dashki wants to go with the party, adn they are half convinced to take him, but Almah refuses, saying that he and Valin are to stay behind to help guard the camp. Valin shrugs. The matter settled, the party waits an hour for the Sand Lions to get a head start and then makes their way to the monastery... and finally Still has a smile as he knows he might get to kill something.</p>

<p>Drexel takes point, and as they approach a ruined wall of the monastery, he can see the track of the coming and goings of the pugwampis. He tells the party and they head through the broken wall, weapons drawn. Inside, there is a ruined columned hallway that leads to a large domed cathedral. The cathedral is lined with broken and overturned marble pews, and the alter at its head appears to be broken. Boomer curses under his breath at the disrespect. Behind the alter, a cracking sun burst mural (a holy symbol of Sarenrae) adorns the wall, above it in the dome is a broken out window that faces east. Above the pews, there are two ruined balconies of choir chairs, supported by rafters that criss cross the ceiling. Amongst the rafters, various bits of old wood and tapestries have been used to construct a hanging tent, and the small footfalls of pugwampus can be seen pressing into the fabric at various locations. IN the center of the room, hanging down from the rafters above, a crude chandelier made of gnoll skulls in various stages of decay hangs down. As the party looks to this rope, a tiny pugwampus is sliding down it onto the chandeleair. As he gets their, he grabs his crotch at the party while giving them the finger as he sways on the chandelier. The party preps for battle.</p>

<p>The party opens with a dagger thrown wide by Sallah, followed up by a solid clunk of a magic shurukin striking home on a pugwampis skull lighting it up with lightning as an arrow fowwols it up dropping the tiny bugger. 3 more pugwampis move onto the rafters above and start shooting arrows at the flat footed boomer. The unluck auro lies heavy in the room, but Boomer gets a bless spell going and surprisingly the party feels the aura lift! The rest of the party momves into postion as Sallah starts climbing the ladder to the balcony and Still tries but misses on an invisible jump up to grab the chandelier. The pugwampus closest to Sallah runs for him and jumps on, getting behind his head and trying to cover his eyes, but he can't get the task done. The next one climbs up and tries to pee in his eyes, but Sallah is to quick. Still gets up the rope and the third one jumps on him, to no avail. The party on the ground keeps launching arrows and spells, a few connecting but a lot of shots going wide. Eventually, one of the dirty little buggers on Sallah manages to rub poop in his eyes, blinding him. Once he gets Sallah blinded he yells out "I blind" and 2 more pugwampus and a fat one wearing a tiny crown step out to take sneak attack shots at him. Sallah shakes off the blindness and starts stabbing the little buggers, and still starts working his way toward the king on the rafters. Nobody tries a scorching ray scroll and a fire ball scroll, he kills one of the little dudes but the king and most the others high reflex saves and evasion skills save them from the damage. Now the one riding on Still manages to grab his eyelids and hold them shut. The king draws his sword, which dangles and jangles with rings (are those cock rings?) and he runs up to slash at Stills nuts. He just misses and hacks his upper thigh instead. With the king and this other guy on him, Still jumps down to the ground so the rest of the party can get at him. Akbar makes the kings sword get real hot, burning him. The king just laughs at him and gives him the finger as his hands smoke and he fights on. Sallah manages to kill one of the guys on him by now, and there are only 3 left. The king jumps off Still and onto Drexel, he does a weird feint then spins around and tries to backhand Drexel in the sack... but he misses and tips through his legs getting a sweaty elf teabag and a mouth full of hair. Drexel pulls a sword and he ans Still start smacking this king down and Sallah keeps hacking at the one on him and Nobody continues a barage of magic force missles and boomer runs around giving everyone guidance. Akbar shakes a stick around and looks like he thinks it should do something, but it doesn't. King Mokknock is still smiling and laughing all the while, and he tries the feinting spinning nut smash on Drexel again. This time, he connects solidly, stunning the elf. He drops his sword and the remaining 3  pugwampus cheer "huzzah" and they all leap toward drexel to deal sneak damage. The dummies take aoos all over the place and both Still and Sallah hack one down each as the last clambers through to poke at Drexel. The last moop is quickly dropped, and now the king isn't smiling. He tries to run, but he still refuses to drop his sword as it burns his hands. Sallah, who had jumped from the balcony and had a bad landing, jumps to his feet and throws his dagger again. It sticks in the running kings back and he falls.</p>

<p>The party loots and cuts ears. They find magic robes, a tiny magic sword of 7 rings, a few hundred in gold, a yet to be identified magic ring, 2 rings of protection +1, a ring of swarming stabs, a ring of positive channeling, a ring of divine knowledge and one other ring that I forget right now.</p>

<p>Looking in the two alcoves next to the chapel, the party sees to relief sculptures of this saint Vardishal. From them they gather that some feared him and some worshiped him, he was concerned about pale mountain, and he may have been a ghost and a "evil spirit" was banished from this place recently by some cleric of adbar. They also find a secret door.</p>

<p>We stop as the party catches their breath, there is still much more of the monastery to explore to ensure it is all safe for occupation.</p>
