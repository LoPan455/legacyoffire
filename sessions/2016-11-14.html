<h2>LoF 10 - 11/14/2016 <br> The Stealthening and Rescue of the Horn and Cap</h2>

<p>It is a few hours till dawn and 2 gnolls are spotted approaching the bridge, most likely drawn by the sounds of songs and axes smashing windows. Akbar and Boomer have also rushed in from the hill to aid in combat with the Harpy… but arrived too late. The party hasn’t yet been spotted,  and are wishing Still was with them. Suddenly one of the gnolls on the bridge grabs his neck and falls to the ground. Still appears from the shadows with swords drawn rushing at the second Gnoll. Boomer quickly tosses a zone of silence on the area, and he does so just in time as the second gnoll brings a horn to his mouth. It blows it to no avail as an arrow from Valin sticks into his shoulder and two arrows from Drexel click off the stones at his feet. Sallah rushes toward the bridge, steathfully avoiding line of sight from the nearby watch tower as Akbar moves to the cover of the nearby building. Drexel loops around the building and finds an open window as Still drops the last gnoll.</p>

<p>Drexel jumps into the building and opens the barred front door for Akbar, Valin, and boomer do a quick search on the building (a magic short sword is found) while Sallah and Still drag/weekend at bernies the gnoll bodies behind the nearby wall of a ruined building. Still explains to Sallah that he has seen Felliped the pathfinder bard who escaped from the gnolls, and wants to go get him before they leave the place. Sallah  agrees that getting him out would be good, and he goes back across the bridge as stealthfully as he can and explains what still is doing and helps search the building… finding a magic ring. Boomer puts darkness on Drexel so he can help get this Felliped across the bridge without being seen, and Drexel crosses the bridge as Still sneaks into the building that he saw Felliped emerge from earlier in the night. After a bit of searching he finds the guy in a hidy hole below the false bottom of a wardrobe. After avoiding a spear thrust he explains that he is here to rescue him and they close up the hidey hole, pour a foul smelling substance on themselves at Felliped’s urging, and head out the window together.</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, Drexel in his cloud of darkness has made his way to the window. He almost gave up their position when peaking in a window to see what the pig sounds he heard were… and realizing that the dire boars inside the stable have the scent ability. Drexel manages to sneak out of scent range and meet up with the other 2, and he gets some nasty liquid as well to cover his scent. They would learn later that it is gnoll piss that Felliped has collected from chamber pots to avoid detection from the boars.</p>

<p>
The 3 of them sneak back across the bridge and join the rest of the team. Plan is to wait until morning for what they now know is a peryton (thanks to felliped) to come back to its nest at dawn. However, they realize that they would really like the horn from that gnoll corpse, and they would prefer the gnoll corpses to be dumped in the river, so Still volunteers to sneak back.</p>

<p>He makes it back to the corpses without being detected, and he manages to collect the horn and the rest of their gear and ditch their bodies in the river. Unfortunately, just as he was about to make it back to the cover of the peryton’s building he was finally spotted by a guard on the watch tower. The alarm is raised and the party decides to run. They high tail it up the hill and disappear into the darkness.</p>

<p>They take a long loop back to the Monastery and get there by dawn. They explain the situation to Almah and crew, and get as much info from Felliped about the battle market and its inhabitance (see map). They learn that this leader, Gyarrgaagn or something like that, enjoys watching people fight on the battle stage in the center of the market. He watched from his throne 3 stories up, and has a clear shot to the stage from there with his bow that he is quite good at using. With him is the gnoll commander, who is a large and vicious flind biotch, and usually Undrella the harpy but I guess she won’t be hanging out there anymore. There is an Ogre known as the strangler that use to be the battle stage champion until Angaleh showed up and beat him. Besides that, there are probably 3 dozen gnolls inside the market, some half orc, human, and bugbear merchants who have taken up residence, and a goblin servant.</p>

<p>Anyway, after this info dump the party orders some bombs from Molly O. and takes a nap. The next day they try unsuccessfully to lure the demon out of the city with the horn and they find that the number of watchers in the ruined buildings around the city has increased. They abandon this plan and head back to the peryton building via a very long loop around and once night falls they try to sneak back in there using a darkenss spell. They see that the bridge now has 8 gnoll guards on it, and those guards hear Akbar as he trys the door to the peryton building inside the darkness (and finds it has been re-barred). The gnolls start shooting arrows into the darkness, Drexel returns fire and Valin steps out of the darkness to return fire as others buff/prep for a fight. The gnolls all shoot at the exposed Valin as an invisible still rapidly approaches them holding a lot of bombs.</p>
