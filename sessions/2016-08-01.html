<h2>8/1/2016</h2>

<p>After a morning of leisure at the manor house of Rayhim the Otherworldly, the party heads off into the bustling market. With Sallah as their guide they are soon all equipped with finer gear, and have word that a man known as Akbar that fits the description of Valin’s brother is waiting for Valin and his 5 traveling companions at the inn in the town of El-Fatar.</p>
 
<p>It appears that Akbar somehow knew that Valin would be arriving in Katapesh, and would have with him exactly 5 companions. How he knew that is a mystery, but he would be waiting for the party’s arrival with a man who goes by the name of Garavel. Salah is also able to discover that Garavel is the Major Domo (aka – head business adviser and accountant) of a Merchant Princess named Almah, who has been tasked by the Pact Masters of Katapesh with securing the ruined city of Kelmarane and returning it to its former glory as the only guarded trading post between the town Solku and the Nation of Osirion. You can only assume Akbar has told Garavel that his brothers adventuring party is worth hiring to help in this task, and is worth waiting for.</p>
 
<p>Knowing that this mission is funded by full backed by the Pact Masters of Katapesh is more than enough incentive, all haste is made to finish stocking up for desert travel and the party sets out that very night for El-Fatar to find Valin’s brother.</p>
 
<p>After 3 days of uneventful travel by ferry up the Scorpious and Pale rivers, and 1 day of dusty travel by camel the party arrives at El-Fatar. It is an ancient crumbling city only recently re-inhabited, with new homes and businesses squatting in the ruins of the cities former glory. They find the inn and wander inside just as the sun drops below the sands. The inn is near empty, save for the thin, old, but very friendly inn keeper and his granddaughter, a few leather skinned caravan guards, a pair of gnome merchants, and two men who seem to be keeping to themselves at the corner table. One is an older gentleman with a lantern jaw graced with well-groomed black beard. He wears a bleach white keffiyeh and traveling cloak over fine merchant clothes. He is sitting at a corner table with a mysterious middle aged stranger that bears a strange resemblance to Valin.</p>
 
<p>As Valin makes a b-line for this latter figure, Boomer and Nobody make a b-line for the gnomes who appear to have a lonely bottle of booze on their table and look like much more interesting conversationalist. As a happy reunion between brothers takes place in the corner of the bar, Nobody and Boomer are quickly in their cups and drawn into a game of bones.</p>
 
<p>Valin explains to Akbar that their family is in ruins, there holdings are lost, and their parents are dead. He asks about a woman named Haleen, it appears that both of them thought the other would know of her whereabouts but neither does. After a quick catch up for Akbar on what Valin has been doing since the holdings fell, introductions are made. The older gentleman with Akbar is indeed Garavel, Major-domo to the merchant princess Almah. He looks each party member over as they are introduced, appearing to be judging their value as best he can by their looks. Akbar explains that he has been wandering the desert for many years, following feelings and whims that there is something here that he needs to find that has to do with the family. He can’t explain what it is, or how he knows these things, but he knows he must continue searching and he is now certain that Almah is the key. His feeling about Valin was right, so he is excited, feeling all may soon be revealed to him.</p>
 
<p>Akbar and Garavel explain that Almah has left with her caravan for Kelmarane 5 days ago, but Akbar had some sort of vision or feeling that even he can’t explain and told Almah that it was destined that his brother would appear soon with 5 adventurers and that they were all fated to come on this mission. Her seer Eloais, a gypsie fortune teller from Varisia who is traveling with Almah, read her cards and agreed that they must wait for this party. Almah’s family has ancient ties to Varisia, and she still holds these seers in very high regard. But she could not delay the preparations. So Garavel and Akbar were left behind. She went ahead with their caravan of supplies, traveling with her are 4 guards, 2 caravan drivers, a gnoll hunting expert named Dashki (to which Drexel grunts in hate as he nods his head approvingly), and 5 mercenaries who call themselves the Sand Lions of Fatar.</p>
 
<p>Sallah explains that he has heard of these lions. They are the ancestors of a band of nomadic orcs that used to live in desert. It is said that in ancient times, these orcs could actually change into lions during battle, but the blood line is ever thinning over the generations and now they are split into rag tag band or half or less than half blood orc mercenaries. They are ferocious in battle, but not knowns for their subtlety.</p>
 
<p>As for the details of the mission, they are slim. Garavel explains that the Pact Masters want the battle market of Kelmarene open again. For 20 years it has laid abandoned. Sallah explains that no one really knows why it was abandoned, but Almah’s family once held this city when it, and her family, were in their prime. Garavel explains that they have heard that the city has recently been inhabited by gnolls (to which Drexel grunts in hate and curses under his breath) and the parties mission will be to help clear Kelmarene and reclaim it for Lady Almah and the Pact masters, then help hold and secure it as a functioning trading post for the east road between Solku and Osirion.</p>
 
<p>Sallah begins to wheel and deal for the party on pay. Garavel offers 200gp per person once the city is reclaimed, plus an additional 500gp per person once 1 year time has past and the city is still held and safe. The party scoffs at this, to which Garavel explains that it appears that this much money must be almost as much as they have earned in their entire lives up to this point. But Still is insistent, saying he knows the going price for a body and that this is not a fair going price for this kind of work. Garavel explains that they will also get the standard mercenary fee of claim over any belongings of the enemies they kill, but Still and Sallah keep pushing, asking for bounty on these enemies as well. Now the whole party is chiming in like some sort of adventurer’s union picket line, so Garavel relents and a deal is made that an additional 50 gold will be paid per Gnoll ear taken from a slain enemy (to which Drexel grunts in hate). Contracts are written and signed as the party spends the rest of the evening getting to know each other.</p>
 
<p>The next day they begin their 5 day journey out towards the sultan’s claw (a land mark the caravan was to be stopping at before approaching Kelmarene). Sallah regales the party with an ancient fable about the origin of Gnolls (to which Drexel grunts in hate). On the 5th day, again arriving around sunset, the party sees a lone tree reaching up for the sky like a clawed hand above the rocky, dusty terrain. They have arrived at the sultans claw, and the caravan has set camp around it… but ONE OF THE WAGONS IS ON FIRE!  Smoke bellows out of the back of covered wagon decorated with a star and moon patterns, as people rush about with pales of water. Goats and camels have been spooked and have escaped their pen and 2 guards have been injured trying to pull someone from the flames. The flames lick dangerously close to a wagon full of barrels of water. Amidst all this chaos, a beautiful, regal looking young woman steps out of her large silk tent, flanked by 2 guards, and begins barking orders. As the party rides up she looks over and yells “Garavel! Arriving just after the nick of time as always. And this must be the fated adventuring party. Well, don’t just sit there. DO SOMETHING!”</p>
 
<p>Nobody rush over to help an older kind looking man try to catch goats. Sallah and Still run in to help put out the fire, Sallah yelling at the two attractive but slightly orcish mercenary women to stop wasting water and throw sand. Akbar runs over to the injured guards, adding his own healing spells alongside old leather skinned cleric who has started doing the same. Valin runs up to help a larger half-orc and an even larger half-orc push the water cart to safety, his added strength is just enough to get the thing moving. Boomer walks over to a Halfling, that appears to have some orcish blood, that is standing off to the side watching the fire and sipping his drink, and he pulls out his flask to join him. The smaller of the two big half orcs yells over in their direction as he grunts under the weight of the water wagon. “Cubby, you little sh!t, get over here and help!” To which the halfing orc sips his cup and responds “Hammod, we were hired to kill gnolls. Putting out fires wasn’t in the contract. You let me know when you want a fire started, till then I’ll be over here.” Boomer and him cheers and both take swigs.</p>
 
<p>The cart safely out of the way and the guards healed, Akbar goes to help with the goats as Valin turns to help put out the fire. But as he approaches the fire jumps to the tree. Valin sees that the jumping fire looked something like a hand… he realizes that is no fire, it’s an elemental! He pulls his ax and sword as he rushes in yelling to inform everyone. The party springs to action. Sallah jumps back as he draws his knife and throws it in for first blood. Still is right behind him as he starts circling the wagon and slashes in with his curved blade. Valin’s ax goes wide, smashing into the charred wagon, but his short sword pokes into elemental flesh. As he fights, he notices a shifty looking guy with a bow kind of cowering behind a small tent on the outskirts of the camp. Akbar rushes in to heal his brother if needed and Drexel starts firing arrows… amazingly more effective than the last time the party saw him do it. The two big half orcs appear to rage out, the smaller of them roaring “Lions, to me” as they both take on a bit more lion like look, their fangs protruding a bit more and their claws growing slightly, and they draw their blades. The lady mercs rage out and start punching, kicking, and clawing at the fire. Cubby… continues to drink. The 4 guards in red plate grab up Almah and the old cleric and form a line between them and the elemental. Valin takes a fire fist to the head, and more slashing, stabbing, and arrow shooting commence and the elemental is put down.</p>
 
<p>The fire subsides. The tree still stands, but is singed. The wagon is burnt husk, as is what is left of Eloais the fortune teller. Valin looks back to the shifty guy with the bow, he has hopped out of hiding and tried to make it look like he was shooting arrows the whole time. Immediately the camp erupts in finger pointing and shouting. Almah yells above the crowd for everyone to shut up and just go back to their tents. She leaves a guard next to the wagon and motions to the party and Garavel to join her in her tent.</p>
 
<p>There are many questions and a hasty introduction. Almah explains that since the party wasn’t here when it started she wants them to figure out what happened. Still and Valin are immediately skeptical of this guy who was hiding behind his tent and they ask about him. He is Dashki, the gnoll hunting expert (to which… you get the Drexel picture). He has been nothing but helpful but the rest of the people on the caravan distrust him and she is sure that they will all point a finger his way if asked. Sallah brings up the fact that a deal should be made for these services. Garavel is slightly taken aback, but then explains that their contract was to free and protect Kelmarene, neither of which would be possible if there is dissention and a murderer in the ranks. Sallah claims this is true, but “there is better deal”. To which Valin, looking over this Almah woman, whispers under his breath perhaps a bit too loudly that this should at least be worth a handy… for sure an over the pants handy as he nods with a grin on his face. Eventually the party agrees to do this for a 100 gp bounty on the perpetrator, and Almah winks at Valin and says they can talk about handies later.</p>
 
<p>As they turn to leave the older slight man who was chasing after the camels and goats comes in and he looks distraught. He explains that Rupert, the stud goat, has gone missing. Without the stud, the herd will not be able to grow as planned once the city is taken. Almah assures him that the goat will be found and Akbar takes special note of this.</p>
 
<p>Sallah stays with Almah to talk with her about the assembled parties. Nobody and Akbar go to look at the wagon, in which they find nothing of interest except evidence that this seer dabbled in alchemy. That done, Akbar goes to see the man about the goat. Boomer wanders off to the mercenaries fire to question them (more likely to get drinks). Drexel, Still, and Valin go to “question” this Dashki character with knives in hands and their most a$$ kickingest expressions on.</p>
 
<p>Dashki is a smelly, ragged, strange man with an odd high pitched voice and a pension for shuttering or cackling under his breath as he talks. His story is quickly suspect and as he is pressed he quickly falls back into some story about how the seer was always messing with alchemy, and he showed him some stone once that he said could summon an elemental when broken. He then starts to claim that the klutzy seer probably dropped the stone, then back peddles and says he that it was probably just bad luck, then jumps to the conclusion that is was a creature called a Pugwampis that must have caused the bad luck. Now he is convinced, confident and certain that pugwampis are around and their bad luck caused the seer to drop his elemental stone. The 3 questioning him are still skeptical, they have never heard of these things, but Dashki says they always follow the gnolls around and worship them like gods, but the gnolls hate them because of their bad luck and are always chasing them away and kill them. He describes them, and although Drexel has never heard of one he does remember seeing a creature like that once around a gnoll camp before.</p>
 
<p>Now Dashki is down right eager about this, he says there must be a pugwampis around and if they hurry out of camp they are sure to find the tracks on the outskirts, he starts heading out into the darkness encouraging the 3 questioning him to come along. The do, and quickly find themselves yards away from the camp, in the dark, with this strange man and it is all quickly become a little creepy.</p>
 
<p>Akbar looks up and realizes his brother is gone. He calls over Sallah and they go off looking for them.</p>
 
<p>Almost convinced this guy is going to try to kill them, the 3 in the desert are on edge. Suddenly, Dashki starts yelling and pointing. Sure enough, he has found tiny humanoid tracks leading into the desert. Following them for a bit, they seem to meet up with the tracks of a goat, that then looks as if it were dragged off into the night. The party all meets up and follows the tracks, Dashki and Drexel leading the way. As they track, the two hunters share similar stories about family members being killed by gnolls and that making them hate the gnolls and vow to kill them… but Drexel seems to have taken the trauma of having loved ones killed by gnolls much better than Dashki.</p>
 
<p>The hunt carries the party into a prickly cactus field. The cacti will be difficult to pick through at any speed, but if they are nimble on their toes they should be able to move through without getting poked. They hear the goat crying out in the middle of the field, and rush forward lighting sun rods and pulling weapons. Drexel fires a sun rod out towards the goat with his bow, and successfully lights the area up. The goat appears to be tied to a large shrub next to a cliff. It is wounded, covered in cactus tines and is very unhappy. Behind it is a cliff, and right below the goat over the cliff is a large Sonora style tree like cactus, its sharp barbed arms reaching up towards the cliffs edge. There are a few boulders scattered about as well.</p>
 
<p>The party rushes forward, and just as they get to the goat 4 tiny rat like man creatures with ugly Jackel-dog heads spring out of hiding onto the rocks shooting tiny short bows. It’s the Pugwampis, they’re real! They party attacks, and quickly (although not to quickly because I forgot for a bit) sees the effects of the unluck aura (roll 2 D20’s, take the worst). It is a drawn out fight as the pugwampis are small and do minimal damage, but are hard to hit as the unluck seeps into the party. Dashki does help the party from a distance with his bow, but he yells advice to the party to late every time. Warning them of the ambush after it happens, and warning them of the unluck aura after they are in it. The party eventually hacks through 2 of the tiny things as Akbar heals and rescues Rupert (almost unluckily tumbling down the cliff but using his walking stick as a board to disperse his weight in the soft sand to avoid it). With only 2 left, one of them says something in gnoll speak then runs and jump off the cliff. The other responds in anger/fear then jumps onto Sallahs face clawing with tiny hands before getting run through like a kabob to end the fight.</p>
 
<p>Drexel translates what they said. The one that ran said “I go warn King Mackmukk, you fight fight.” And the other responded “Me fight fight ?!!?!? Noooo!”</p>
 
<p>With that, the party maneuvers Rupert out of the cacti and heads back to camp.</p>
