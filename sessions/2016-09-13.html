<h2>9/13/2016</h2>

<p>The party wakes to Almah calling for a meeting in the cathedral and food in an hour. The casters begin to prep spells and Akbar wakes from his trance with a sense of excitement and urgency about him. He tells the party that there is urgent business and they must come with him immediately… which is met with some hesitation from those who need to prep spells and put on armor. Akbar is undeterred and still very excited, and he explains that they won’t need spells and it will just take a minute. To which Nobody replies –“You’ve been in a trance since we have known you, you can wait.” Still calmly makes smart a$$ comments in agreement as he carefully dips a shuriken in his new poison. Sallah steps forward to address the group – ‘My friends, my friends…. The a$$hole has a point.” And he heads back into his bed to meditate.
</p>
 
<p>Eventually Akbar gets the party going, and he excitedly goes over all the frescoes and murals and explains how they tell a story of the history of the area which most of the party already picked up on, but its good to review. When he is done he leads the party to the center of the very overgrown courtyard garden and explains that somehow he and Vardishai are linked now thanks to that ooze sucking on his face. Vardishai’s spirit has somehow transferred to this ooze and has now transferred to him and  lives in him, and somehow he knew he was looking for this all along as he wandered the desert.
</p>
 
<p>Anyway, he has also gotten the sense that there is something very important buried in this spot in the courtyard and they must dig. Still goes on watch and they start digging with hands and turn up some big eggs. Valin thinks he knows what they are, but his brother quickly corrects him and explains that they are Geier eggs, which is a large vulture like bird. The eggs can fetch some cash in the right market, or can be eaten. The party stashes them away somewhere…. (Although some discussion may need to be had on how they were stored and where these were put, since I assume you guys aren’t running around with giant eggs in your backpacks). Akbar explains this isn’t the thing he is seeking and Valin runs off to talk with Hadrah and Sarah about shovels.
</p>
 
<p>Valin lies and says he needs to dig a latrine, and Hadrah commends his work ethic and gives him some shovels.  Valin and Akbar decide to dig during the meeting,  while Still keeps watch and everyone else ensures the rest of the group is distracted. After some digging they discover Vardishai’s body, complete with the windward ax, the leeward leeward, and a cloak of resistance +2. Akbar trances out and explains the magical properties of all the equipment. He takes the staff and feels his constitution slightly improve. Valin takes the ax and feels his improve as well. Valin also takes the cloak and throws his hand me downs to Nobody, who takes it but not without some snarky comments about being the a$$ end of the equipment train. They move Vardishai’s body to the crypts.
</p>
 
<p>At the meeting, Almah explains the ground rules for keeping their presence at the monetary hidden from the occupants of Kelmarene. She agrees with the party that the next step should be scouting of the city, and agrees that the pcs are the ones to do it. The sand lions protest that they haven’t’ got to kill anything, but Sllah makes a good argument for the PCs pointing out that even as they speak Still has disappeared beneath their noses, so obviouslhy they are the right ones for the job. The party agrees to let the sand lions of fatar clear the pesh fields while they loop around through the old shrine and check the city out from there. The sand lions agree, but won’t go to the pesh fields until night fall to avoid drawing attention (besides, they all have dark vision and no one in the group does). The PCs take off immediately for the shrine, even though they just agreed to help Almah clean out the library and Valin said he was going to dig a latrine.
</p>
 
<p>At the shrine, they find it is in rough shape. Many of the walls are crumbling and the statues and frescoes are all eroded away do to pummeling by wind swept sand. The party cleans out some spider swarms at the reflecting pool, realizing perhaps they should stock up on alchemical splash weapons and bludgeoning weapons when they get a chance, and shows some stellar trap setting off skills in the first room of the basement (hey, this statue burned the hell out of us, lets touch the next one!). Eventually they find themselves in a myst filled room with what appears to some to be an old decrepit ship floating in the middle of it, but appears to Akbar and Nobody as the most beautiful ship they have ever seen that is floating among the clouds. As the party approaches the ship, someone talks to them and a weird were-housecat looking woman appears on the mast of the ship.  Valin smashes the front of the ship with his Ax, as the rest of the party moves in and starts attacking the cat lady. They notice she kind of looks likes one of the people in the carving of the Templar of the 7 winds, but she is trying to kill them with ice and stones so they don’t much care. Sallah whips her right off the mast onto her a$$ with his ball and chain, and Akbar commands her to approach him letting her take a ton of AOOs in the process. Nobody gets on the ship and claims it as his own as Still stabs the crap out of cat ladies face and she dies. As she dies, she turns into a human and looks a lot like the carving of Dunyizad, Nefeshti’s master of magic from the temple carvings. Nobody and Akbar are still loopy, but not loopy enough to not loot this body, on which they find the Torrent Staff and a strange kukri carved with a  panther design. Akbar trances and tells the party what the staff is and what it does. Nobody claims it and feels his charisma has gone up a bit. More loot to follow.

<p>End.
