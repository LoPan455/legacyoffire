<h2>8/27/2016</h2>

<p>The party took a second to make sure everyone was healed up and distribute the magic rings found on King Mokknock. When Nobody took the unidentified ring, it actually magically resized into a thin metal crown which he placed on his head and tried to activate blindly. A streak of white light shot out of the crown and burned the wall in front of him.</p>
 
<p>The two alcoves to either side of the cathedral were re-examined. In one it appears there was once a small shrine and wooden alter, but both had been smashed decades ago. A huge bas-relief statue of a muscular humanoid with a pointy beard adorns the wall behind the alter. In one hand he holds a battle ax, and in the other a strange staff. He is gesturing towards a huge mountain in the background, his face a picture of mortal concern. This man was identified as Vardishal, one of the Templars of the 7 winds, who was the Djinni princess Nefeshti’s chief advisor and bodyguard. The mountain in the background was identified as Pale Mountain, the largest mountain in the Brazen Peaks, the area north east of Kelmarane long in control of gnolls and other monsters. In the other alcove, there is a similar statue of Vardishal, but in this one he appears on a hilltop before a group of robed pilgrims, his hands held up, palms out, in a sign of peace. Some of the worshipers seem horrified while others are have a much more beatific expression. A crude stone carving has been mande at the base of this relief, obviously carved hastily and much more recently then the rest of the carving. It reads “A ghost of unholy mien was purged from this place by Theodephus Estrovan, servant of Aroden, 4691 AR”  (the party is reminded that the current year is 4719). There is a secret door that was found in the easern wall of this alcoves bas-relief, Still checks it out and has Valin, who just showed up and doesn’t want to talk about why he’s late, open the door.</p>
 
<p>The party moves into what appears to be a magically sustained and overgrown garden of living plants in a completely enclosed small room. This must have been a place for the worshipers to seek rest and contemplation in private. It is difficult to move through, but Still does manage to find another secret door on the far wall and again checks it and has Valin push through.</p>
 
<p>Through this door the party finds a large octoganal room, the floor slick with blood and gore. Various animal carcasses have been left here to decay and rot. Looking up it appears this is some kind of tower. The ceiling is 30 ft above and at each of the 6 wall intersections above a leering gargoyle sculpture looks down upon the floor. The roof has started to collapse and there are numerous holes in it, some as large as 5 ft in diameter. As Valin enters the room, a strange buzzing sound comes from 3 of the gargoyles. Striges that were resting on the statues take flight and attack the party. Everyone rushes into the room to get clear shots as the large bugs swoop down. One attempts to grab onto Still, but it misses. Unfortunately, Sallah gets he DP action as the remaining two attach on either side of him. Arrows and force missiles fly, and one of the bugs is dropped. Sallah stabs the one attached to his front and Valin finishes it off with a mighty ax blow. Still gets some swipes in, using his new 2 bladed fighting style. Another force missile strikes the one on Sallah’s back. Then, telling Sallah to stand really still, Drexel skewers it with an arrow from 30ft. The party searches through the gore to find a few loose coins then continues out the door to the south.</p>
 
<p>This door opens into a long hallway that turns a corner both to the east and west. On the other side of the hallway, there appears to be a large archway that opens into a central outdoor garden, also choked with desert brush and overgrown almost to the point of being impassible. The wall behind them has a long bas-releif sculpture. But before they can get enough light on it to make it out, the party hears footsteps approaching from the archway that leads out toward the chapel to the west. Still sneaks up ahead to get a better view, and he sees 4 baboons approaching from the ruined hallway the party used to enter the building. On each of the baboons rides a Pugwamus, the one in front appears to have a little monkey skull helmet and a neckless made of small bones. As the leader turns the corner to the hallway he easily spots the party and falls back as he yells to his allies to “Stab stab kill kill!”</p>
 
<p>Arrows fly out from Valin and Drexel, but fail to do much damage. The leader casts a spell, and the weeds in the nearby garden start to grow and weave their way across the floor, covering a large area all the way back and around the corner where Sallah still waits to enter the room. Sallah and Valin are held fast by the entangling weeds, and they now choke the area making the pugwami difficulty to get to. Two of the 3 remaining riders seem to barely be able to control their mounts and the baboons rush forward. One even runs right into the entangle area! The final one manages to maintain control and flings rocks at Valin from his sling. Still rushes up invisibly to get himself into position to strike the leader. Unfortunately, Nobody doesn’t know that. He whips out a scroll of fireball and lights the place up, dropping all but the leader, his mount, and one remaining pugwami. Still manages to avoid the brunt of the damage, but is still singed. He comes out of invisibly with a deadly sneak attack on the small shamen, as Drexel fires arrows finishing off the last of them.  They loot the cloak of resistance, which goes to Drexel, and other items off him and the party heals up and waits for the plants to clear away before moving around to check out the center garden and the carvings surrounding it.</p>
 
<p>The center garden is almost to choked with weeds to search, but the party manages to hack their way through only to come up empty handed. Surrounding the garden, carved into the walls of the hallways, are 4 bas-relief sculptures described as follows:</p>
 
<h3>A4. North Cloister</h3>
<p>A sweeping bas-relief sculpture along the north wall depicts 7 larger-than-life humans riding the wind with triumph carved upon their faces. Though some of their arms and hands are missing, each is clearly meant to wield a distinctive weapon. One of the five warriors holds a large axe, while another holds a fragment of what must once have been a regal staff. In the distance, an ominous mountain looms over the group.</p>
 
<h3>A5. East Cloister</h3>
<p>The eastern cloister walk abuts what must be the outer wall of the monastery itself. The lengthy wall bears a marred sculpture depicting the seven figures from the north cloister mural in battle against numerous creatures of evil demeanor. Several of the creatures appear to be composed at least partly of fire, while others are much more difficult to define, being outright monstrous and of unknown origin or unusual warriors with weapons bonded into their flesh like organic tools. In the background Pale Mountain looms large, and over it two titanic figures lock in a deadly wrestler’s embrace. One has the demoniac visage of a noble efreeti, while the other is a gorgeous woman who could only be a djinni princess</p>
 
<h3>A6. South Cloister</h3>
<p>The southern wall bears a bas-relief sculpture in the form of a triptych. In the first scene, a Vardishal takes leave of six similarly attired companions, who rise off into the heavens, leaving him to stand vigil over the large mountain in the background. The next scene depicts the bearded figure in battle with a flaming half man, half snake creature wielding a spear. The fire spirit transfixes the bearded hero with the spear, seemingly striking a killing blow. In the final scene, the hero appears twice—once on the ground with a wound in his back and once standing over this form, looking down upon it sadly.</p>
 
<h3>A7. West Cloister</h3>
<p>The outer wall of the west cloister passage bears a massive carving. The central figure—the heroic man with the pointed beard—preaches to a variety of human clerics from throughout the long history of the monastery. The first image depicts the figure manifesting in a spiritual manner to a small group of pilgrims of Sarenrae. Another shows the figure conversing with a man in religious finery while the monastery itself is being constructed in the background. Thereafter follows a procession of similar poses, each depicting a visit by the bearded man and the leader of each era of the temple. The depictions of these clerics often also bear an identifying inscription, complete with dates that span the last several hundred years. The most recent carving is from around thirty years ago, and while ample room remains for additional carvings on the west wall, the last thirty feet or so are completely blank.
</p>
 
<p>From here the party heads into the small alcove in the north east corner of the hallways. Once inside, they see a small chapel, the walls brightly painted and covered with wooden plates traced in gold filigree, each showing what appears to be Vardishal in various heroic acts. It appears perhaps a quarter of the gold has been hacked away by long absent vandals and many of the wooden plates are marred by what appears to be ax blow and blows from other blunt objects. Opposite the door, dominating the north wall, is a larger than life sized statue of Vardishal. The statue holds both hands out in front of him, cradling a small child in his arms and looking down upon it with adoration. Looking at Vardishal’s face in this statue, and the face of the child, the party sees an odd resemblance between them, Valin, and Akbar. Upon entering the room, Akbar looks upon all the carvings and immediatly in filled with a sense of excitement and wonder. He starts muttering to himself, saying things like “This is it” and “NO, something is not right” “ It must be here” He must be here”. As he touches the statue his eyes roll back into his head and he goes into a trance like coma. Where his hand touched, Still finds a secret door that opens to a staircase leading down into darkness. At about the same time, Drexel spots a long dried stain of blood on the ground, which appears to trail off down the stairs.
</p>
 
<p>The party heads down the stairs, below they find a ruined alchemy lab, with 3 stone tables that appear to be covered in some sort of brown/green mold. Tables to the east and west are covered with old papers. To the west, a narrow tunnel leads back into what appears to be the crypts, and it is down this hallway that the trail of blood leads.
</p>
 
<p>Before anyone can make any decisions, Akbar rushes down the stairs and straight to the table on the west wall. He still appears to be half in his trance, muttering “he is here, he is here”. He reaches out to the table, knocking over two glass beakers. The brown mold contained in these two beakers appears to be moving of its own accord, and one of them lashes out and engulfs Akbars head, tendrils of ooze penetrating his nose, mouth and ears. Sallah warns everyone that this appears to be some sort of living brown mold and that it will probably multiply if you hit it with fire, and everyone starts hammering away at the oozes. After a round, the ooze seeps off of Akbar’s face, and he appears stuck in his trance. Boomer rushes in and pulls him out of danger area and attempts to heal him… but Akbar appears fine besides the fact that he is stuck in this trance. The oozes prove to be fairly easy to hit, and beside some cold damage no one else gets engulfed before the threat is put down with massive amounts of arrows, slashing weapons, and whirling balls of death. The party leaves Akbar with Boomer and heads intot he crypts.
</p>
 
<p>It appears that all of the older bodies in the crypts have been unceremoniously pulled from their resting places and burned. A few of the niches now hold bodies that are not as old. The blood drops lead to the end of the dark hallway, where a man in fine breastplate rests upon a slab. He appears just as alive as anyone, and sits up and addresses the party. Sallah quickly sees through the illusion and sees him as the rotted corpse he is. Sallah calls his bluff, and the undead creature says they will burn like all the other heretics and attacks. IN close quarters Still, Valin, and Sallah slash and bash the sh!t out of this thing, with a crit destroying it. It appears to use the same whirling ball like weapon that Sallah just started using, and has enchanted ones that Sallah takes. It also has an amulet of nat armor, that goes to Valin, and a mithril breastplate that goes to Still. Nobody starts to feel left out, and tries to activate his crown again to no avail. They see that this undead dude had a key of adbar hanging around his neck with some strange runes on it, and verify that all the other bodies that haven’t been desecrated down here have the same holy symbol on them.
</p>
 
<p>The party heads back upstairs and checks out the living quarter’s area of the temple. They find a library full of books that have been used as toilet paper, but there is one book about the Templars of the 7 winds that will add bonuses to knowledge checks. They find a room with 5 beds and some trunks full of baboon poop. In the kitchen and mess hall there is a fat pugwampis with a chefs hat on, he is quickly killed. In the final room are 10 bunk beds and a doorway to another ruined tower that has some big scorpions in it that are quickly put down. Still takes the tail of the one Sallah didn’t explode with his balls of death to try and extract poison out of it later.  With that, the tower is clean. Back tracking the baboon riders, the party confirms that they did not come from Kelmarine. So, they head back to camp to tell Almah the job is done.
</p>
 
<p>Almah and party break camp and everyone moves into the temple and begins cleaning things out and setting it up as a base of operations. There is lots of poop and other horrible things to clean. Still asks the camp cleric, Father Zastoran, to extract the scorpion poison for him. He offers the alchemical formulas in trade. Zastoran agrees and throws in a half full wand of cure light to make the deal fair.
</p>
 
<p>Almah and Garavel take the library as their quarters. The pact master guard set up in the 5 bed room next door. The goats and other livestock are put in the cathedral, and Hardrah and Sarah (goat herder and cook) set up camp in the west alcove outside the door. The Lions of Fatar take the ruined hallway so they can be first line of defense. Daski claims the octoganal chamber, and father Zastoran takes the alchemical lab in the basement. The party takes the bunk room, making sure to seal up the entrance to the ruined tower with old furniture.
</p>
 
<p>Akbar still has not come out of his trance….
