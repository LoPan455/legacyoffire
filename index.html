<h2>7/11/2016</h2>


<p>After arriving into port on a ship from Absalom Boomer the gnome cleric convinces his new best friends to accompany him to Jerikal’s ales for a drink. Having nothing better to do, Still the Elf Ninja, Nobody the Elf Wizard, and Valin the Human Ranger decide to tail along. During the journey Boomer had been quite instant that the 3 non-merchant looking dudes on the boat become friends with him even though Still kind of just stood around silently Valin did not partake in the alcohol. Nobody and Boomer were quickly becoming friends do to their shared love of Lizards (which they both have) and a love of all things narcotic.</p>
 
<p>Unbeknownst to the 4 new arrivals, Sallah of the fraternal order of dervishes had just overheard that an ancient temple or fortress of unknown origian was just unveiled by the shifting sands about 6 hours north of town. He quickly got a hold of some horses and camels and went to Jerikal’s looking for adventuring companions who would be willing to leave with him immediately to beat any other would be explorers to the site. He quickly spotted Drexel the Half Elf ranger, and knowing the dark skinned elf is always up for hunting evil creatures he quickly got his on and off business contact onto the mission. They looked about the room trying to find others to approach. Seeing a party with a brooding elf and a muscle bound human both armed to the teeth hanging out with a drunk gnome and an elf who looked to be a wizard, they figured they found their mark.</p>
 
<p>They approached and quickly realized the gnome was drunk as a skunk, but they convinced the other 3 to come adventure with them. The Elves were easy enough to convince, but Sallah found that Valin was looking for his brother, and Sallah had to make promises that he would help locate them as soon as they return. Nobody, not wanting to leave his new best friend behind, convinced the cleric to come drink on a camel (cause the probably hasn’t before) and Boomer decided to join in on the journey with intention of watching over the mounts while the party explores.</p>
 
<p>A quick, uneventful journey through the desert brought them to a tilted domed structure half exposed in the side of a sand dune. The front had a large door and a broken out 15ft diameter window. The side walls showed signs of wear, with large chucks of stone missing in various locations, but the white dome appeared to be marble or some other tough stone and in fairly good shape. Circling around the structure, someone spotted a hole that had been broken in the top of the dome. It was quickly decided that checking in the roof would be the first move, and Still was sent up to quietly scope it out.</p>
 
<p>Inside he saw a Lizard like humanoid (troglodyte) and a horse sized horned lizard crackling with electric energy. He tried to sign back to his friends, but they didn’t totally understand. The rest of the party decided to climb up and join him, but of course the clunky climbing of Valin brought the attention of the creatures in the room. Nobody and Drexel began hammering away at the shock lizard with their bows as Still dropped a rope down and rappelled into the room, being followed closely by Sallah and Valin. The shock lizard did what shock lizards do, and it hurt. The troglodyte was a druid, and put out a flaming sphere and started summoning something. Once down, the bowmen continued to work the lizard from the roof as the 3 inside rushed at the troglodyte. Nobody managed to get a perfect shot through the lizards eye and put it down, but the 3 on the ground were finding the humanoid hard to hit. To make matters worse, as Valin rushed in to take his first swing at the floor beneath everyone collapsed under his weight… at least that summoning spell was interrupted : )</p>
 
<p>The troglodyte and Valin dropped 60 ft to the stone floor below as Still and Sallah jumped back to safety. Valin was unconscious, maybe dead. Nobody and Drexel quickly dropped into the room as Still set up a second line to get down to Valin. At about that time Boomer dropped in from the roof to give everyone a channel and made his way up to the ledge to help. AS they watched from above, they saw a web shoot out from somewhere and coat Valin, and the troglodyte stood up and ran for the cover of the back of the room… they better hurry. Sallah went first to try to get to Valin and heal him. As he dropped down, more troglodytes on the floors below stepped up to the ledge and began throwing javalins. Still was next down the line followed by boomer, Drexel, and a hesitant Nobody who would have preferred to stay up top and wait for a target.</p>
 
<p>Once on the ground, Sallah and Boomer got Valin up on his feet. Still and Sallah went after the troglodyte as Drexel and Nobody worked on the new giant spider threat. It was touch and go for a bit, with Still going unconscious at one point as well and the troglodyte continuing to be difficult to hit… but the party managed to finally put him down and clear the first floor. The troglodytes in the middle floor unable to throw javelins at them as long at they stay away from the hole in the ceiling, the new party then finally stopped to catch their breath.</p>

 
<p>End</p>

<h2>7/25/216</h2>


<p>The party makes sure everyone is healed, then examines the doorway to the central stair. Still listens to the door, hears the plunking of small pebbles falling inside. Valin opens the door then jumps out of the way as a wall of rock falls forward through the opening. It appears some of the central stairway has collapsed and this entrance to the stairs is blocked.</p>
 
<p>Still sneaks up to look at their rope hanging from the edge of the collapsed area of the top floor, he see those two javelin throwing Trogs that they repelled passed are laying on the ground of the floor above and scanning the lower room from the edge so they can determine if their leader was victorious or dead.  Still creeps back and the party decides they must flee through the front entrance and come back around the temple and climb to the roof again.</p>
 
<p>Salah uses dancing lights to distract javelin throwing Troglodytes watching from above, and the party makes a break for the door. Everyone except Valin gets through before the Trogs can react to the party, as they are too busy throwing javelins at the dancing lights. One javelin tossed at Valin goes wide and then the party ducks around the corner and is out of range.</p>
 
<p>Drexel is sent out on camel guard duty while the rest of the party continues the exploration.</p>
 
<p>They climb back to the top of the building, Still listens to the roof and hears nothing, they then drop through the hole in the roof and make their way down the center stair.</p>

 
<p>Still listens the sh!t out of all the doors they encounter from here on before having Valin kick it open with weapons drawn (with one exception noted below). They find an ancient armory, which Nobody scans with detect magic to quickly find a magic dagger, a single magic arrow, and a magic nail that appears to be some crude version of a throwing star. They also find some masterwork leather armor and a composite longbow with a +2 strength pull. Through the next door they then find an empty room that looks like it might be a make shift sleeping quarters and then bust open the door behind the two javelin chucking Trogs.</p>
 
<p>First Trog gets and arrow to the skull that almost brains him, but is deflected by a boney horn (crit not confirmed). Valin then steps up and hits that arrow square with the blade of his ax, and drives ax and arrow all the way out the other side (crit!). Still, Salah, and Boomer move into the room and a couple swings go wide as Salah starts dancing, then Nobody and Valin deliver the same one/two punch to the second Trog, sticking him with an arrow then cutting him down (who the hell invited Carl anyway).  With both Trogs down, the party could have stopped to catch their breath… but there is a door here that is already cracked open and Still and Salah are hungry for battle after watching Valin and nobody take all the glory. Valin, first through every door, gets pushed aside by Still who is immediately clubbed into unconsciousness by the huge Trog barbarian waiting to bean the first adventurer through the door (probably should have listened at that one). Behind this barbarian are 2 more Trogs and what appears to be an unconscious tied up woman.</p>
 
<p>Another arrow, this time the found magic one, flies true into the barbarian from Nobody, and it explodes with electric energy! It is followed by ax and sword WIFFS! by Valin (about time). It seems the one/two punch is not flawless. Salah spins into the room still in his dance and delivers a whirling dagger strike to the barbarian. But this barbarian is no fool. Surrounded by melee fighters he charges out of the room towards the wizard, delivering a solid club strike… but luckily for Nobody the swing just misses and smacks the ground next to him. Boomer goes to heal Still and Valin, stepping between the barbarian and the wizard, delivers a solid smack with his ax. Salah throws his new magic dagger, and it smack hard into the wall next to the barbarian. Amazingly it floats into the air and begins to return to him. Still sees this awesomeness and decides to throw his newly found magic star. It sticks hard into the barbarians face and explodes with magic energy dropping the barbarian. Arrows and daggers make quick work of one of the two remaining Trogs, and the last one drops his weapons and surrenders.</p>
 
<p>Boomer goes over to start healing the captive, who turns out to be a beautiful young wizard named Baleena. Nobody translates the Trog’s pleas for his life in dragonic to Still, Salah, and Valin who still stand around him. But mid sentence the Trog makes a strange contorted face and falls to the ground dead, leaking from a puncture wound in his kidney. Still totally has no idea what happened and the party goes to talk with Baleena.</p>
 
<p>With everyone needing to heal up, boomer does his best but is getting low on spells. They search the barbarian body and find a few potions, a masterworked club, and some gold. Still hands one to Valin that looks kind of like his other cure potions and says “Here, this should totally heal you.” Trusting Valin drinks it down…. Luckily it actually heals him quite a bit.</p>
 
<p>The Lady Baleena, now fully healed, asks if the party has gone through the rune covered door below. They say they were just heading there. She offers to come with and help the party if she is allowed 8 hours rest to regen spells. She does say that Rayhim will want first dibs on any magical artifacts found on the floor below, but will pay the party handsomely for their help. The party talks it over, agrees to let her go into her trance for study, and then leaves her with Drexel (who they call back in from camel duty) and head downstairs without her.</P>
 
<p>Down the stairs, the rune covered door is listened to and examined by Still who is quite convinced there could be no traps at all on this door (natural 1) and tells Valin to open it. The runes explode, filling the stairwell with fire. Everyone heals up a bit with potions then then head inside.</p>
 
<p>Inside they see a temple, the walls are covered with decaying tapestries depicting images of the Nethys, god of magic. There is an alter in front of them in a room mostly decorated with white, to symbolize the good aspect of magic. Around the corner is a very black room with another alter, symbolizing the dark magic aspect of Nethys. Just inside the door is the charred remains of a Troglodyte. Heading toward the white alter, Valin stops in his tracks as two skeletons on the ground rise up. They have swords in their hand and their boney bodies ignite bathing them in flames.</p>
 
<p>Nobody fires force missiles at them from a scroll. Still moves in and slashes wide, and Salah starts his dance. Then Valin charges. Continuing the one/two punch he swings his ax into the creature. It tries to block with its boney arm but the ax cleaves through arm, ribs, and spine (another crit!). The skeleton collapses into a pile of bones and Valin scoffs at the minor burning sensation he feels on his ax arm as he makes the kill. The remaining skeleton unleashes a torrent of flaming claws at Still… but Still nimbly dodges all the attacks. Nobody fires and arrow but misses. Still, having had enough of Valin taking all the kills and maybe reminded of his skills by the quiet death of the cowering Trog upstairs, takes his elven curve blade and cleaves down on the skeletons head. The blade passes through its skull and into its collar bone, and the skeleton drops like a rock (another crit!). The flames go out and the party goes in to inspect the alters.</p>
 
<p>On each alter they find a spell book and two scrolls. The spell books contain spells that are too high of a level to be useful to Nobody, but their ancient origin no doubt would make them a good find for a high level wizard. The party grabs up the scrolls (2 communal energy resistance, 2 fireball) and stuffs them in Nobody’s pack. They then grab the books and head back upstairs.</p>
 
<p>They wake Baleena and tell her the job is done, handing her the books. Surprised, she goes downstairs to take note of the tapestries then they all decide to make haste back to Katapesh before some other party comes to claim their prize. As dawn breaks, the party plus Baleena is riding through “Dawn Gate” in Katapesh and are met by Rayhim’s party that was heading out to explore the temple. They are escorted back to Rayhim’s estate and enjoy his hospitality for the morning as he reviews their findings. He rewards the party handsomely and expresses his gratitude for the rescue of his student Baleena.</p>
 
<p>If they ever have need of his services to identify any artifacts or seek information about other dimensions or planes of existence, he would be happy to oblige. (FORESHADOW)</p>

<h2>8/1/2016</h2>

<p>After a morning of leisure at the manor house of Rayhim the Otherworldly, the party heads off into the bustling market. With Sallah as their guide they are soon all equipped with finer gear, and have word that a man known as Akbar that fits the description of Valin’s brother is waiting for Valin and his 5 traveling companions at the inn in the town of El-Fatar.</p>
 
<p>It appears that Akbar somehow knew that Valin would be arriving in Katapesh, and would have with him exactly 5 companions. How he knew that is a mystery, but he would be waiting for the party’s arrival with a man who goes by the name of Garavel. Salah is also able to discover that Garavel is the Major Domo (aka – head business adviser and accountant) of a Merchant Princess named Almah, who has been tasked by the Pact Masters of Katapesh with securing the ruined city of Kelmarane and returning it to its former glory as the only guarded trading post between the town Solku and the Nation of Osirion. You can only assume Akbar has told Garavel that his brothers adventuring party is worth hiring to help in this task, and is worth waiting for.</p>
 
<p>Knowing that this mission is funded by full backed by the Pact Masters of Katapesh is more than enough incentive, all haste is made to finish stocking up for desert travel and the party sets out that very night for El-Fatar to find Valin’s brother.</p>
 
<p>After 3 days of uneventful travel by ferry up the Scorpious and Pale rivers, and 1 day of dusty travel by camel the party arrives at El-Fatar. It is an ancient crumbling city only recently re-inhabited, with new homes and businesses squatting in the ruins of the cities former glory. They find the inn and wander inside just as the sun drops below the sands. The inn is near empty, save for the thin, old, but very friendly inn keeper and his granddaughter, a few leather skinned caravan guards, a pair of gnome merchants, and two men who seem to be keeping to themselves at the corner table. One is an older gentleman with a lantern jaw graced with well-groomed black beard. He wears a bleach white keffiyeh and traveling cloak over fine merchant clothes. He is sitting at a corner table with a mysterious middle aged stranger that bears a strange resemblance to Valin.</p>
 
<p>As Valin makes a b-line for this latter figure, Boomer and Nobody make a b-line for the gnomes who appear to have a lonely bottle of booze on their table and look like much more interesting conversationalist. As a happy reunion between brothers takes place in the corner of the bar, Nobody and Boomer are quickly in their cups and drawn into a game of bones.</p>
 
<p>Valin explains to Akbar that their family is in ruins, there holdings are lost, and their parents are dead. He asks about a woman named Haleen, it appears that both of them thought the other would know of her whereabouts but neither does. After a quick catch up for Akbar on what Valin has been doing since the holdings fell, introductions are made. The older gentleman with Akbar is indeed Garavel, Major-domo to the merchant princess Almah. He looks each party member over as they are introduced, appearing to be judging their value as best he can by their looks. Akbar explains that he has been wandering the desert for many years, following feelings and whims that there is something here that he needs to find that has to do with the family. He can’t explain what it is, or how he knows these things, but he knows he must continue searching and he is now certain that Almah is the key. His feeling about Valin was right, so he is excited, feeling all may soon be revealed to him.</p>
 
<p>Akbar and Garavel explain that Almah has left with her caravan for Kelmarane 5 days ago, but Akbar had some sort of vision or feeling that even he can’t explain and told Almah that it was destined that his brother would appear soon with 5 adventurers and that they were all fated to come on this mission. Her seer Eloais, a gypsie fortune teller from Varisia who is traveling with Almah, read her cards and agreed that they must wait for this party. Almah’s family has ancient ties to Varisia, and she still holds these seers in very high regard. But she could not delay the preparations. So Garavel and Akbar were left behind. She went ahead with their caravan of supplies, traveling with her are 4 guards, 2 caravan drivers, a gnoll hunting expert named Dashki (to which Drexel grunts in hate as he nods his head approvingly), and 5 mercenaries who call themselves the Sand Lions of Fatar.</p>
 
<p>Sallah explains that he has heard of these lions. They are the ancestors of a band of nomadic orcs that used to live in desert. It is said that in ancient times, these orcs could actually change into lions during battle, but the blood line is ever thinning over the generations and now they are split into rag tag band or half or less than half blood orc mercenaries. They are ferocious in battle, but not knowns for their subtlety.</p>
 
<p>As for the details of the mission, they are slim. Garavel explains that the Pact Masters want the battle market of Kelmarene open again. For 20 years it has laid abandoned. Sallah explains that no one really knows why it was abandoned, but Almah’s family once held this city when it, and her family, were in their prime. Garavel explains that they have heard that the city has recently been inhabited by gnolls (to which Drexel grunts in hate and curses under his breath) and the parties mission will be to help clear Kelmarene and reclaim it for Lady Almah and the Pact masters, then help hold and secure it as a functioning trading post for the east road between Solku and Osirion.</p>
 
<p>Sallah begins to wheel and deal for the party on pay. Garavel offers 200gp per person once the city is reclaimed, plus an additional 500gp per person once 1 year time has past and the city is still held and safe. The party scoffs at this, to which Garavel explains that it appears that this much money must be almost as much as they have earned in their entire lives up to this point. But Still is insistent, saying he knows the going price for a body and that this is not a fair going price for this kind of work. Garavel explains that they will also get the standard mercenary fee of claim over any belongings of the enemies they kill, but Still and Sallah keep pushing, asking for bounty on these enemies as well. Now the whole party is chiming in like some sort of adventurer’s union picket line, so Garavel relents and a deal is made that an additional 50 gold will be paid per Gnoll ear taken from a slain enemy (to which Drexel grunts in hate). Contracts are written and signed as the party spends the rest of the evening getting to know each other.</p>
 
<p>The next day they begin their 5 day journey out towards the sultan’s claw (a land mark the caravan was to be stopping at before approaching Kelmarene). Sallah regales the party with an ancient fable about the origin of Gnolls (to which Drexel grunts in hate). On the 5th day, again arriving around sunset, the party sees a lone tree reaching up for the sky like a clawed hand above the rocky, dusty terrain. They have arrived at the sultans claw, and the caravan has set camp around it… but ONE OF THE WAGONS IS ON FIRE!  Smoke bellows out of the back of covered wagon decorated with a star and moon patterns, as people rush about with pales of water. Goats and camels have been spooked and have escaped their pen and 2 guards have been injured trying to pull someone from the flames. The flames lick dangerously close to a wagon full of barrels of water. Amidst all this chaos, a beautiful, regal looking young woman steps out of her large silk tent, flanked by 2 guards, and begins barking orders. As the party rides up she looks over and yells “Garavel! Arriving just after the nick of time as always. And this must be the fated adventuring party. Well, don’t just sit there. DO SOMETHING!”</p>
 
<p>Nobody rush over to help an older kind looking man try to catch goats. Sallah and Still run in to help put out the fire, Sallah yelling at the two attractive but slightly orcish mercenary women to stop wasting water and throw sand. Akbar runs over to the injured guards, adding his own healing spells alongside old leather skinned cleric who has started doing the same. Valin runs up to help a larger half-orc and an even larger half-orc push the water cart to safety, his added strength is just enough to get the thing moving. Boomer walks over to a Halfling, that appears to have some orcish blood, that is standing off to the side watching the fire and sipping his drink, and he pulls out his flask to join him. The smaller of the two big half orcs yells over in their direction as he grunts under the weight of the water wagon. “Cubby, you little sh!t, get over here and help!” To which the halfing orc sips his cup and responds “Hammod, we were hired to kill gnolls. Putting out fires wasn’t in the contract. You let me know when you want a fire started, till then I’ll be over here.” Boomer and him cheers and both take swigs.</p>
 
<p>The cart safely out of the way and the guards healed, Akbar goes to help with the goats as Valin turns to help put out the fire. But as he approaches the fire jumps to the tree. Valin sees that the jumping fire looked something like a hand… he realizes that is no fire, it’s an elemental! He pulls his ax and sword as he rushes in yelling to inform everyone. The party springs to action. Sallah jumps back as he draws his knife and throws it in for first blood. Still is right behind him as he starts circling the wagon and slashes in with his curved blade. Valin’s ax goes wide, smashing into the charred wagon, but his short sword pokes into elemental flesh. As he fights, he notices a shifty looking guy with a bow kind of cowering behind a small tent on the outskirts of the camp. Akbar rushes in to heal his brother if needed and Drexel starts firing arrows… amazingly more effective than the last time the party saw him do it. The two big half orcs appear to rage out, the smaller of them roaring “Lions, to me” as they both take on a bit more lion like look, their fangs protruding a bit more and their claws growing slightly, and they draw their blades. The lady mercs rage out and start punching, kicking, and clawing at the fire. Cubby… continues to drink. The 4 guards in red plate grab up Almah and the old cleric and form a line between them and the elemental. Valin takes a fire fist to the head, and more slashing, stabbing, and arrow shooting commence and the elemental is put down.</p>
 
<p>The fire subsides. The tree still stands, but is singed. The wagon is burnt husk, as is what is left of Eloais the fortune teller. Valin looks back to the shifty guy with the bow, he has hopped out of hiding and tried to make it look like he was shooting arrows the whole time. Immediately the camp erupts in finger pointing and shouting. Almah yells above the crowd for everyone to shut up and just go back to their tents. She leaves a guard next to the wagon and motions to the party and Garavel to join her in her tent.</p>
 
<p>There are many questions and a hasty introduction. Almah explains that since the party wasn’t here when it started she wants them to figure out what happened. Still and Valin are immediately skeptical of this guy who was hiding behind his tent and they ask about him. He is Dashki, the gnoll hunting expert (to which… you get the Drexel picture). He has been nothing but helpful but the rest of the people on the caravan distrust him and she is sure that they will all point a finger his way if asked. Sallah brings up the fact that a deal should be made for these services. Garavel is slightly taken aback, but then explains that their contract was to free and protect Kelmarene, neither of which would be possible if there is dissention and a murderer in the ranks. Sallah claims this is true, but “there is better deal”. To which Valin, looking over this Almah woman, whispers under his breath perhaps a bit too loudly that this should at least be worth a handy… for sure an over the pants handy as he nods with a grin on his face. Eventually the party agrees to do this for a 100 gp bounty on the perpetrator, and Almah winks at Valin and says they can talk about handies later.</p>
 
<p>As they turn to leave the older slight man who was chasing after the camels and goats comes in and he looks distraught. He explains that Rupert, the stud goat, has gone missing. Without the stud, the herd will not be able to grow as planned once the city is taken. Almah assures him that the goat will be found and Akbar takes special note of this.</p>
 
<p>Sallah stays with Almah to talk with her about the assembled parties. Nobody and Akbar go to look at the wagon, in which they find nothing of interest except evidence that this seer dabbled in alchemy. That done, Akbar goes to see the man about the goat. Boomer wanders off to the mercenaries fire to question them (more likely to get drinks). Drexel, Still, and Valin go to “question” this Dashki character with knives in hands and their most a$$ kickingest expressions on.</p>
 
<p>Dashki is a smelly, ragged, strange man with an odd high pitched voice and a pension for shuttering or cackling under his breath as he talks. His story is quickly suspect and as he is pressed he quickly falls back into some story about how the seer was always messing with alchemy, and he showed him some stone once that he said could summon an elemental when broken. He then starts to claim that the klutzy seer probably dropped the stone, then back peddles and says he that it was probably just bad luck, then jumps to the conclusion that is was a creature called a Pugwampis that must have caused the bad luck. Now he is convinced, confident and certain that pugwampis are around and their bad luck caused the seer to drop his elemental stone. The 3 questioning him are still skeptical, they have never heard of these things, but Dashki says they always follow the gnolls around and worship them like gods, but the gnolls hate them because of their bad luck and are always chasing them away and kill them. He describes them, and although Drexel has never heard of one he does remember seeing a creature like that once around a gnoll camp before.</p>
 
<p>Now Dashki is down right eager about this, he says there must be a pugwampis around and if they hurry out of camp they are sure to find the tracks on the outskirts, he starts heading out into the darkness encouraging the 3 questioning him to come along. The do, and quickly find themselves yards away from the camp, in the dark, with this strange man and it is all quickly become a little creepy.</p>
 
<p>Akbar looks up and realizes his brother is gone. He calls over Sallah and they go off looking for them.</p>
 
<p>Almost convinced this guy is going to try to kill them, the 3 in the desert are on edge. Suddenly, Dashki starts yelling and pointing. Sure enough, he has found tiny humanoid tracks leading into the desert. Following them for a bit, they seem to meet up with the tracks of a goat, that then looks as if it were dragged off into the night. The party all meets up and follows the tracks, Dashki and Drexel leading the way. As they track, the two hunters share similar stories about family members being killed by gnolls and that making them hate the gnolls and vow to kill them… but Drexel seems to have taken the trauma of having loved ones killed by gnolls much better than Dashki.</p>
 
<p>The hunt carries the party into a prickly cactus field. The cacti will be difficult to pick through at any speed, but if they are nimble on their toes they should be able to move through without getting poked. They hear the goat crying out in the middle of the field, and rush forward lighting sun rods and pulling weapons. Drexel fires a sun rod out towards the goat with his bow, and successfully lights the area up. The goat appears to be tied to a large shrub next to a cliff. It is wounded, covered in cactus tines and is very unhappy. Behind it is a cliff, and right below the goat over the cliff is a large Sonora style tree like cactus, its sharp barbed arms reaching up towards the cliffs edge. There are a few boulders scattered about as well.</p>
 
<p>The party rushes forward, and just as they get to the goat 4 tiny rat like man creatures with ugly Jackel-dog heads spring out of hiding onto the rocks shooting tiny short bows. It’s the Pugwampis, they’re real! They party attacks, and quickly (although not to quickly because I forgot for a bit) sees the effects of the unluck aura (roll 2 D20’s, take the worst). It is a drawn out fight as the pugwampis are small and do minimal damage, but are hard to hit as the unluck seeps into the party. Dashki does help the party from a distance with his bow, but he yells advice to the party to late every time. Warning them of the ambush after it happens, and warning them of the unluck aura after they are in it. The party eventually hacks through 2 of the tiny things as Akbar heals and rescues Rupert (almost unluckily tumbling down the cliff but using his walking stick as a board to disperse his weight in the soft sand to avoid it). With only 2 left, one of them says something in gnoll speak then runs and jump off the cliff. The other responds in anger/fear then jumps onto Sallahs face clawing with tiny hands before getting run through like a kabob to end the fight.</p>
 
<p>Drexel translates what they said. The one that ran said “I go warn King Mackmukk, you fight fight.” And the other responded “Me fight fight ?!!?!? Noooo!”</p>
 
<p>With that, the party maneuvers Rupert out of the cacti and heads back to camp.</p>

<h2>8/8/2016</h2>

As the last pugwampi fell, Deshki was quick to gather up one of the corpses. He cackled to himself as he tied its tiny corpse to his walking stick. "You see! You all see! Dashki no lie! Here is proof. Proof! hehehe" Still notices Dashki slyly checking the pockets of the little creature and pocketing the coins for himself, but decides this filthy "man" is not worth slicing up... yet. The party checks over the rest of the pugwampus corpses, and finds a few scattered coins and a few of the late camp seer's harrow cards, further proof that these things were responsible for the fire. The matter settled, and the one that ran off yelling for this "King Mokknock" long gone into the night, they head back to camp with Rupert the goat in tow. 

<p>The Sand Lions and the Goat Herder, Cook, and Cleric are all by the fire eating, the Sand Lions again hitting the cups. The party all makes a b-line for Almah's tent. They are stopped before they get there by Hadrah and Sarah, the goat herder and the cook. Hadrah is almost in tears he is so happy to see Rupert returned. He kisses Akbar on the cheeks wishing him a thousand blessings and calling all of the party great men. Sarah gives them all hugs and promises double meat and mead in their servings. Thanking them respectfully, and with a nod from the two Pact Guards at the tent door, the party heads into Almah's tent. Garavel and Almah are inside reviewing a map and talking. As the party enters they stand to greet them, and Dashki immediately waves his pugwampus corpse in their faces triumphantly. "You see! Pugwampus. Dashki is truth! No lies, you trust Dashki you should! hehhehehe" The party explains what they encountered and shows Almah the harrow cards. Garavel pays them the 100gp promised for the investigation, but when Sallah asks for bounty on the pugwampis Garavel explains that there are no ears as proof so he will not pay. The party shrugs it off and they are told to rest and eat this night and the next step will be discussed in the morning.</p>

<p>Still goes off to speak with the camp cleric Father Zastoran about getting his wounds healed. He is taken to the fathers caravan wagon and told to sit on a table. The wagon is full of strange alchemical contraptions and ointments. Father Zastoran casts a cure spell on him and rubs strange smelling balms on his wounds and bandages them, all the while lecturing Still about how he should be more careful and that all this healing does cost resources. The father makes a tally on a sheet. Still asks the father what he knows about poisons, the father tells him he knows enough to know that everyone should avoid them at all costs. The people trying to employ the vile stuff are usually the ones who get poisoned. Sick of this lecture, Still quietly stand and leaves without another word.</p>

<p>Back at the fire, Boomer and Nobody are experimenting with pesh while Akbar takes in the scene and just listens to get to know the sand lions a bit better. He gathers that Hammod the Grim, the smaller of the two large male half orcs, is the leader he is very full of pride and honors tradition above all else. The vary large male with the very big sword goes by the name Kazeem, and he doesn't say much. He just seems to grunt and point at things. Akbar learns later from Sallah that Kazeem's tongue was cut out by gnolls, but he is dense anyway so he would never have had a chance to lead the pack. Besides, Hammod apparently has the strongest bloodline and is the closest connected with the traditions. The two female monks look much more human than the two males, and appear to be related... maybe even twins. They are called Fata and Sasha. The halfling appears to barely have any orc blood in him at all, and everyone calls him Cubby. He appears to be an arcane caster of some sort and "Cubby" appears to be a nickname, perhaps one he isn't to fond of but has gotten used to, most likely related to his small stature among the Sand Lions. It appears that Sallah has had some drinks and has cozied up with the Sand sisters. They seem to be getting along very well. They seem to point at Still and ask some questions, Still remains his stoic self and Sallah sees to distract them with other stories as he leads them away from the fire. Akbar realizes that Valin is nowhere to be seen, figures he may have snuck off to go see if he can get a private audience with Almah. Dashki is still at the fire. He eats ravenously, taking everything he is offered and everything no one else wants. When asked he says that you should always eat as much as possible when food is available because you never know when you will next get a meal. The rest of the night passes without issue.</p>

<p>In the morning, Almah gathers everyone in the camp. She passes around a crude map and explains that the fire and attack last night has made their camp at the sultans claw to vulnerable. There is an abandoned monastery, once a holy place of some saint of Sarenrae, that lies a mile north through the hills. IF it can be cleared out, it would be a defensible location to set up camp and start excursions into Kelmarene. Someone asks about the saints name, Almah says it was Saint Vardishai. Akbar feels a strange sense of dejavu when he hears that name. With that information, Akbar goes into a strange trance for a few minutes. When he snaps out of it, he appears to know everything about Saint Vardishai, his membership in the Templars of the Seven Winds, who each of the other 6 Templars were and what famous weapons they used, their relation to the Djinn Nefeshti and the groups general mission to oppose the god of destruction Rovogug (see coming attachment).  All that information spewed forth, the party gets back to the task at hand.</p>

<p>They ask briefly about he other structures on the map. All she knows about the shrine is that it had something to do with some god of magic. The fort, she explains, is most likely heavily guarded by gnolls, because it guards the pass to Pale Mountain and White Canyon, both known Gnoll territories. She is asked again why Kelmarene was abandoned, she says no one really knows, but whatever happened the Pact Masters turned away from it, leaving it to its fate. She seems a bit sad about that. She says she was very young when it fell, and she was taken from their by her Aunt. She believes her parents died there. When the Pact Masters decided they needed it in their fold again, Almah was not going to pass on the opportunity. Akbar goes into another strange trance. This time, when he pops out of it he says he heard rumors it had something to do with Daemons. Almah does seem to react to that, but she keeps her cool demeanor and says that those are just old wives tale, just like the tales of the undead or the plague or any other such fancy.</p>

<p>Back to the task at hand, Almah explains the monastery is to be taken without drawing a lot of attention, so the party is chosen to take go in first. Hammod is very upset at this and the voices his opinions bout it loudly. Almah says that the Sand Lions tactics would draw to much attention and likly leave the place in ruins anyway, so the lions are to be the fallback. They are to loop wide around the monastery and watch the path between there and Kelmarene, ensuring no information of the attack makes it back to the city. Dashki wants to go with the party, adn they are half convinced to take him, but Almah refuses, saying that he and Valin are to stay behind to help guard the camp. Valin shrugs. The matter settled, the party waits an hour for the Sand Lions to get a head start and then makes their way to the monastery... and finally Still has a smile as he knows he might get to kill something.</p>

<p>Drexel takes point, and as they approach a ruined wall of the monastery, he can see the track of the coming and goings of the pugwampis. He tells the party and they head through the broken wall, weapons drawn. Inside, there is a ruined columned hallway that leads to a large domed cathedral. The cathedral is lined with broken and overturned marble pews, and the alter at its head appears to be broken. Boomer curses under his breath at the disrespect. Behind the alter, a cracking sun burst mural (a holy symbol of Sarenrae) adorns the wall, above it in the dome is a broken out window that faces east. Above the pews, there are two ruined balconies of choir chairs, supported by rafters that criss cross the ceiling. Amongst the rafters, various bits of old wood and tapestries have been used to construct a hanging tent, and the small footfalls of pugwampus can be seen pressing into the fabric at various locations. IN the center of the room, hanging down from the rafters above, a crude chandelier made of gnoll skulls in various stages of decay hangs down. As the party looks to this rope, a tiny pugwampus is sliding down it onto the chandeleair. As he gets their, he grabs his crotch at the party while giving them the finger as he sways on the chandelier. The party preps for battle.</p>

<p>The party opens with a dagger thrown wide by Sallah, followed up by a solid clunk of a magic shurukin striking home on a pugwampis skull lighting it up with lightning as an arrow fowwols it up dropping the tiny bugger. 3 more pugwampis move onto the rafters above and start shooting arrows at the flat footed boomer. The unluck auro lies heavy in the room, but Boomer gets a bless spell going and surprisingly the party feels the aura lift! The rest of the party momves into postion as Sallah starts climbing the ladder to the balcony and Still tries but misses on an invisible jump up to grab the chandelier. The pugwampus closest to Sallah runs for him and jumps on, getting behind his head and trying to cover his eyes, but he can't get the task done. The next one climbs up and tries to pee in his eyes, but Sallah is to quick. Still gets up the rope and the third one jumps on him, to no avail. The party on the ground keeps launching arrows and spells, a few connecting but a lot of shots going wide. Eventually, one of the dirty little buggers on Sallah manages to rub poop in his eyes, blinding him. Once he gets Sallah blinded he yells out "I blind" and 2 more pugwampus and a fat one wearing a tiny crown step out to take sneak attack shots at him. Sallah shakes off the blindness and starts stabbing the little buggers, and still starts working his way toward the king on the rafters. Nobody tries a scorching ray scroll and a fire ball scroll, he kills one of the little dudes but the king and most the others high reflex saves and evasion skills save them from the damage. Now the one riding on Still manages to grab his eyelids and hold them shut. The king draws his sword, which dangles and jangles with rings (are those cock rings?) and he runs up to slash at Stills nuts. He just misses and hacks his upper thigh instead. With the king and this other guy on him, Still jumps down to the ground so the rest of the party can get at him. Akbar makes the kings sword get real hot, burning him. The king just laughs at him and gives him the finger as his hands smoke and he fights on. Sallah manages to kill one of the guys on him by now, and there are only 3 left. The king jumps off Still and onto Drexel, he does a weird feint then spins around and tries to backhand Drexel in the sack... but he misses and tips through his legs getting a sweaty elf teabag and a mouth full of hair. Drexel pulls a sword and he ans Still start smacking this king down and Sallah keeps hacking at the one on him and Nobody continues a barage of magic force missles and boomer runs around giving everyone guidance. Akbar shakes a stick around and looks like he thinks it should do something, but it doesn't. King Mokknock is still smiling and laughing all the while, and he tries the feinting spinning nut smash on Drexel again. This time, he connects solidly, stunning the elf. He drops his sword and the remaining 3  pugwampus cheer "huzzah" and they all leap toward drexel to deal sneak damage. The dummies take aoos all over the place and both Still and Sallah hack one down each as the last clambers through to poke at Drexel. The last moop is quickly dropped, and now the king isn't smiling. He tries to run, but he still refuses to drop his sword as it burns his hands. Sallah, who had jumped from the balcony and had a bad landing, jumps to his feet and throws his dagger again. It sticks in the running kings back and he falls.</p>

<p>The party loots and cuts ears. They find magic robes, a tiny magic sword of 7 rings, a few hundred in gold, a yet to be identified magic ring, 2 rings of protection +1, a ring of swarming stabs, a ring of positive channeling, a ring of divine knowledge and one other ring that I forget right now.</p>

<p>Looking in the two alcoves next to the chapel, the party sees to relief sculptures of this saint Vardishal. From them they gather that some feared him and some worshiped him, he was concerned about pale mountain, and he may have been a ghost and a "evil spirit" was banished from this place recently by some cleric of adbar. They also find a secret door.</p>

<p>We stop as the party catches their breath, there is still much more of the monastery to explore to ensure it is all safe for occupation.</p>

<h2>8/27/2016</h2>

<p>The party took a second to make sure everyone was healed up and distribute the magic rings found on King Mokknock. When Nobody took the unidentified ring, it actually magically resized into a thin metal crown which he placed on his head and tried to activate blindly. A streak of white light shot out of the crown and burned the wall in front of him.</p>
 
<p>The two alcoves to either side of the cathedral were re-examined. In one it appears there was once a small shrine and wooden alter, but both had been smashed decades ago. A huge bas-relief statue of a muscular humanoid with a pointy beard adorns the wall behind the alter. In one hand he holds a battle ax, and in the other a strange staff. He is gesturing towards a huge mountain in the background, his face a picture of mortal concern. This man was identified as Vardishal, one of the Templars of the 7 winds, who was the Djinni princess Nefeshti’s chief advisor and bodyguard. The mountain in the background was identified as Pale Mountain, the largest mountain in the Brazen Peaks, the area north east of Kelmarane long in control of gnolls and other monsters. In the other alcove, there is a similar statue of Vardishal, but in this one he appears on a hilltop before a group of robed pilgrims, his hands held up, palms out, in a sign of peace. Some of the worshipers seem horrified while others are have a much more beatific expression. A crude stone carving has been mande at the base of this relief, obviously carved hastily and much more recently then the rest of the carving. It reads “A ghost of unholy mien was purged from this place by Theodephus Estrovan, servant of Aroden, 4691 AR”  (the party is reminded that the current year is 4719). There is a secret door that was found in the easern wall of this alcoves bas-relief, Still checks it out and has Valin, who just showed up and doesn’t want to talk about why he’s late, open the door.</p>
 
<p>The party moves into what appears to be a magically sustained and overgrown garden of living plants in a completely enclosed small room. This must have been a place for the worshipers to seek rest and contemplation in private. It is difficult to move through, but Still does manage to find another secret door on the far wall and again checks it and has Valin push through.</p>
 
<p>Through this door the party finds a large octoganal room, the floor slick with blood and gore. Various animal carcasses have been left here to decay and rot. Looking up it appears this is some kind of tower. The ceiling is 30 ft above and at each of the 6 wall intersections above a leering gargoyle sculpture looks down upon the floor. The roof has started to collapse and there are numerous holes in it, some as large as 5 ft in diameter. As Valin enters the room, a strange buzzing sound comes from 3 of the gargoyles. Striges that were resting on the statues take flight and attack the party. Everyone rushes into the room to get clear shots as the large bugs swoop down. One attempts to grab onto Still, but it misses. Unfortunately, Sallah gets he DP action as the remaining two attach on either side of him. Arrows and force missiles fly, and one of the bugs is dropped. Sallah stabs the one attached to his front and Valin finishes it off with a mighty ax blow. Still gets some swipes in, using his new 2 bladed fighting style. Another force missile strikes the one on Sallah’s back. Then, telling Sallah to stand really still, Drexel skewers it with an arrow from 30ft. The party searches through the gore to find a few loose coins then continues out the door to the south.</p>
 
<p>This door opens into a long hallway that turns a corner both to the east and west. On the other side of the hallway, there appears to be a large archway that opens into a central outdoor garden, also choked with desert brush and overgrown almost to the point of being impassible. The wall behind them has a long bas-releif sculpture. But before they can get enough light on it to make it out, the party hears footsteps approaching from the archway that leads out toward the chapel to the west. Still sneaks up ahead to get a better view, and he sees 4 baboons approaching from the ruined hallway the party used to enter the building. On each of the baboons rides a Pugwamus, the one in front appears to have a little monkey skull helmet and a neckless made of small bones. As the leader turns the corner to the hallway he easily spots the party and falls back as he yells to his allies to “Stab stab kill kill!”</p>
 
<p>Arrows fly out from Valin and Drexel, but fail to do much damage. The leader casts a spell, and the weeds in the nearby garden start to grow and weave their way across the floor, covering a large area all the way back and around the corner where Sallah still waits to enter the room. Sallah and Valin are held fast by the entangling weeds, and they now choke the area making the pugwami difficulty to get to. Two of the 3 remaining riders seem to barely be able to control their mounts and the baboons rush forward. One even runs right into the entangle area! The final one manages to maintain control and flings rocks at Valin from his sling. Still rushes up invisibly to get himself into position to strike the leader. Unfortunately, Nobody doesn’t know that. He whips out a scroll of fireball and lights the place up, dropping all but the leader, his mount, and one remaining pugwami. Still manages to avoid the brunt of the damage, but is still singed. He comes out of invisibly with a deadly sneak attack on the small shamen, as Drexel fires arrows finishing off the last of them.  They loot the cloak of resistance, which goes to Drexel, and other items off him and the party heals up and waits for the plants to clear away before moving around to check out the center garden and the carvings surrounding it.</p>
 
<p>The center garden is almost to choked with weeds to search, but the party manages to hack their way through only to come up empty handed. Surrounding the garden, carved into the walls of the hallways, are 4 bas-relief sculptures described as follows:</p>
 
<h3>A4. North Cloister</h3>
<p>A sweeping bas-relief sculpture along the north wall depicts 7 larger-than-life humans riding the wind with triumph carved upon their faces. Though some of their arms and hands are missing, each is clearly meant to wield a distinctive weapon. One of the five warriors holds a large axe, while another holds a fragment of what must once have been a regal staff. In the distance, an ominous mountain looms over the group.</p>
 
<h3>A5. East Cloister</h3>
<p>The eastern cloister walk abuts what must be the outer wall of the monastery itself. The lengthy wall bears a marred sculpture depicting the seven figures from the north cloister mural in battle against numerous creatures of evil demeanor. Several of the creatures appear to be composed at least partly of fire, while others are much more difficult to define, being outright monstrous and of unknown origin or unusual warriors with weapons bonded into their flesh like organic tools. In the background Pale Mountain looms large, and over it two titanic figures lock in a deadly wrestler’s embrace. One has the demoniac visage of a noble efreeti, while the other is a gorgeous woman who could only be a djinni princess</p>
 
<h3>A6. South Cloister</h3>
<p>The southern wall bears a bas-relief sculpture in the form of a triptych. In the first scene, a Vardishal takes leave of six similarly attired companions, who rise off into the heavens, leaving him to stand vigil over the large mountain in the background. The next scene depicts the bearded figure in battle with a flaming half man, half snake creature wielding a spear. The fire spirit transfixes the bearded hero with the spear, seemingly striking a killing blow. In the final scene, the hero appears twice—once on the ground with a wound in his back and once standing over this form, looking down upon it sadly.</p>
 
<h3>A7. West Cloister</h3>
<p>The outer wall of the west cloister passage bears a massive carving. The central figure—the heroic man with the pointed beard—preaches to a variety of human clerics from throughout the long history of the monastery. The first image depicts the figure manifesting in a spiritual manner to a small group of pilgrims of Sarenrae. Another shows the figure conversing with a man in religious finery while the monastery itself is being constructed in the background. Thereafter follows a procession of similar poses, each depicting a visit by the bearded man and the leader of each era of the temple. The depictions of these clerics often also bear an identifying inscription, complete with dates that span the last several hundred years. The most recent carving is from around thirty years ago, and while ample room remains for additional carvings on the west wall, the last thirty feet or so are completely blank.
</p>
 
<p>From here the party heads into the small alcove in the north east corner of the hallways. Once inside, they see a small chapel, the walls brightly painted and covered with wooden plates traced in gold filigree, each showing what appears to be Vardishal in various heroic acts. It appears perhaps a quarter of the gold has been hacked away by long absent vandals and many of the wooden plates are marred by what appears to be ax blow and blows from other blunt objects. Opposite the door, dominating the north wall, is a larger than life sized statue of Vardishal. The statue holds both hands out in front of him, cradling a small child in his arms and looking down upon it with adoration. Looking at Vardishal’s face in this statue, and the face of the child, the party sees an odd resemblance between them, Valin, and Akbar. Upon entering the room, Akbar looks upon all the carvings and immediatly in filled with a sense of excitement and wonder. He starts muttering to himself, saying things like “This is it” and “NO, something is not right” “ It must be here” He must be here”. As he touches the statue his eyes roll back into his head and he goes into a trance like coma. Where his hand touched, Still finds a secret door that opens to a staircase leading down into darkness. At about the same time, Drexel spots a long dried stain of blood on the ground, which appears to trail off down the stairs.
</p>
 
<p>The party heads down the stairs, below they find a ruined alchemy lab, with 3 stone tables that appear to be covered in some sort of brown/green mold. Tables to the east and west are covered with old papers. To the west, a narrow tunnel leads back into what appears to be the crypts, and it is down this hallway that the trail of blood leads.
</p>
 
<p>Before anyone can make any decisions, Akbar rushes down the stairs and straight to the table on the west wall. He still appears to be half in his trance, muttering “he is here, he is here”. He reaches out to the table, knocking over two glass beakers. The brown mold contained in these two beakers appears to be moving of its own accord, and one of them lashes out and engulfs Akbars head, tendrils of ooze penetrating his nose, mouth and ears. Sallah warns everyone that this appears to be some sort of living brown mold and that it will probably multiply if you hit it with fire, and everyone starts hammering away at the oozes. After a round, the ooze seeps off of Akbar’s face, and he appears stuck in his trance. Boomer rushes in and pulls him out of danger area and attempts to heal him… but Akbar appears fine besides the fact that he is stuck in this trance. The oozes prove to be fairly easy to hit, and beside some cold damage no one else gets engulfed before the threat is put down with massive amounts of arrows, slashing weapons, and whirling balls of death. The party leaves Akbar with Boomer and heads intot he crypts.
</p>
 
<p>It appears that all of the older bodies in the crypts have been unceremoniously pulled from their resting places and burned. A few of the niches now hold bodies that are not as old. The blood drops lead to the end of the dark hallway, where a man in fine breastplate rests upon a slab. He appears just as alive as anyone, and sits up and addresses the party. Sallah quickly sees through the illusion and sees him as the rotted corpse he is. Sallah calls his bluff, and the undead creature says they will burn like all the other heretics and attacks. IN close quarters Still, Valin, and Sallah slash and bash the sh!t out of this thing, with a crit destroying it. It appears to use the same whirling ball like weapon that Sallah just started using, and has enchanted ones that Sallah takes. It also has an amulet of nat armor, that goes to Valin, and a mithril breastplate that goes to Still. Nobody starts to feel left out, and tries to activate his crown again to no avail. They see that this undead dude had a key of adbar hanging around his neck with some strange runes on it, and verify that all the other bodies that haven’t been desecrated down here have the same holy symbol on them.
</p>
 
<p>The party heads back upstairs and checks out the living quarter’s area of the temple. They find a library full of books that have been used as toilet paper, but there is one book about the Templars of the 7 winds that will add bonuses to knowledge checks. They find a room with 5 beds and some trunks full of baboon poop. In the kitchen and mess hall there is a fat pugwampis with a chefs hat on, he is quickly killed. In the final room are 10 bunk beds and a doorway to another ruined tower that has some big scorpions in it that are quickly put down. Still takes the tail of the one Sallah didn’t explode with his balls of death to try and extract poison out of it later.  With that, the tower is clean. Back tracking the baboon riders, the party confirms that they did not come from Kelmarine. So, they head back to camp to tell Almah the job is done.
</p>
 
<p>Almah and party break camp and everyone moves into the temple and begins cleaning things out and setting it up as a base of operations. There is lots of poop and other horrible things to clean. Still asks the camp cleric, Father Zastoran, to extract the scorpion poison for him. He offers the alchemical formulas in trade. Zastoran agrees and throws in a half full wand of cure light to make the deal fair.
</p>
 
<p>Almah and Garavel take the library as their quarters. The pact master guard set up in the 5 bed room next door. The goats and other livestock are put in the cathedral, and Hardrah and Sarah (goat herder and cook) set up camp in the west alcove outside the door. The Lions of Fatar take the ruined hallway so they can be first line of defense. Daski claims the octoganal chamber, and father Zastoran takes the alchemical lab in the basement. The party takes the bunk room, making sure to seal up the entrance to the ruined tower with old furniture.
</p>
 
<p>Akbar still has not come out of his trance….
</p>

<h2>9/13</h2>

<p>The party wakes to Almah calling for a meeting in the cathedral and food in an hour. The casters begin to prep spells and Akbar wakes from his trance with a sense of excitement and urgency about him. He tells the party that there is urgent business and they must come with him immediately… which is met with some hesitation from those who need to prep spells and put on armor. Akbar is undeterred and still very excited, and he explains that they won’t need spells and it will just take a minute. To which Nobody replies –“You’ve been in a trance since we have known you, you can wait.” Still calmly makes smart a$$ comments in agreement as he carefully dips a shuriken in his new poison. Sallah steps forward to address the group – ‘My friends, my friends…. The a$$hole has a point.” And he heads back into his bed to meditate.
</p>
 
<p>Eventually Akbar gets the party going, and he excitedly goes over all the frescoes and murals and explains how they tell a story of the history of the area which most of the party already picked up on, but its good to review. When he is done he leads the party to the center of the very overgrown courtyard garden and explains that somehow he and Vardishai are linked now thanks to that ooze sucking on his face. Vardishai’s spirit has somehow transferred to this ooze and has now transferred to him and  lives in him, and somehow he knew he was looking for this all along as he wandered the desert.
</p>
 
<p>Anyway, he has also gotten the sense that there is something very important buried in this spot in the courtyard and they must dig. Still goes on watch and they start digging with hands and turn up some big eggs. Valin thinks he knows what they are, but his brother quickly corrects him and explains that they are Geier eggs, which is a large vulture like bird. The eggs can fetch some cash in the right market, or can be eaten. The party stashes them away somewhere…. (Although some discussion may need to be had on how they were stored and where these were put, since I assume you guys aren’t running around with giant eggs in your backpacks). Akbar explains this isn’t the thing he is seeking and Valin runs off to talk with Hadrah and Sarah about shovels.
</p>
 
<p>Valin lies and says he needs to dig a latrine, and Hadrah commends his work ethic and gives him some shovels.  Valin and Akbar decide to dig during the meeting,  while Still keeps watch and everyone else ensures the rest of the group is distracted. After some digging they discover Vardishai’s body, complete with the windward ax, the leeward leeward, and a cloak of resistance +2. Akbar trances out and explains the magical properties of all the equipment. He takes the staff and feels his constitution slightly improve. Valin takes the ax and feels his improve as well. Valin also takes the cloak and throws his hand me downs to Nobody, who takes it but not without some snarky comments about being the a$$ end of the equipment train. They move Vardishai’s body to the crypts.
</p>
 
<p>At the meeting, Almah explains the ground rules for keeping their presence at the monetary hidden from the occupants of Kelmarene. She agrees with the party that the next step should be scouting of the city, and agrees that the pcs are the ones to do it. The sand lions protest that they haven’t’ got to kill anything, but Sllah makes a good argument for the PCs pointing out that even as they speak Still has disappeared beneath their noses, so obviouslhy they are the right ones for the job. The party agrees to let the sand lions of fatar clear the pesh fields while they loop around through the old shrine and check the city out from there. The sand lions agree, but won’t go to the pesh fields until night fall to avoid drawing attention (besides, they all have dark vision and no one in the group does). The PCs take off immediately for the shrine, even though they just agreed to help Almah clean out the library and Valin said he was going to dig a latrine.
</p>
 
<p>At the shrine, they find it is in rough shape. Many of the walls are crumbling and the statues and frescoes are all eroded away do to pummeling by wind swept sand. The party cleans out some spider swarms at the reflecting pool, realizing perhaps they should stock up on alchemical splash weapons and bludgeoning weapons when they get a chance, and shows some stellar trap setting off skills in the first room of the basement (hey, this statue burned the hell out of us, lets touch the next one!). Eventually they find themselves in a myst filled room with what appears to some to be an old decrepit ship floating in the middle of it, but appears to Akbar and Nobody as the most beautiful ship they have ever seen that is floating among the clouds. As the party approaches the ship, someone talks to them and a weird were-housecat looking woman appears on the mast of the ship.  Valin smashes the front of the ship with his Ax, as the rest of the party moves in and starts attacking the cat lady. They notice she kind of looks likes one of the people in the carving of the Templar of the 7 winds, but she is trying to kill them with ice and stones so they don’t much care. Sallah whips her right off the mast onto her a$$ with his ball and chain, and Akbar commands her to approach him letting her take a ton of AOOs in the process. Nobody gets on the ship and claims it as his own as Still stabs the crap out of cat ladies face and she dies. As she dies, she turns into a human and looks a lot like the carving of Dunyizad, Nefeshti’s master of magic from the temple carvings. Nobody and Akbar are still loopy, but not loopy enough to not loot this body, on which they find the Torrent Staff and a strange kukri carved with a  panther design. Akbar trances and tells the party what the staff is and what it does. Nobody claims it and feels his charisma has gone up a bit. More loot to follow.
</p>
 
<p>End.
</p>

<h2>9/30/2016 -<br>The Caster Biotch Fight and Enter the Hamster Cat</h2>

<p>As the looting of the body of this Djann wraps up, Nobody rushes back to the decrepid floating barge, still thinking it’s his luxury yacht. Akbar is also still confused and he rushes back up there as well. This pisses Nobody off something fierce, and will yells of “Get off my boat!” he blasts Akbar with a  force missle. This starts the repeat loop of confused attacks between the two casters, as Akbar shoves Nobody off, and Nobody reponds with a lightning bolt from his new staff. From there it is nothing but lightning from both sides while the others start to shout “Kumite, Kumit…”. Boomer moves in to cure whomever drops first. Meanwhile, Valin is still over by the body and the statue near him starts talking to him. It says random stuff like “Who holds the power” and “Whom do you serve”. The other statue chimes in too, and he and Sallah notice that the mist that is confusing the casters is coming from the statues mouths. Sallah tries smashing a statue, but the cracks he makes start to bleed mist so he decides that’s a bad idea. Valin rips the cloak off the dead Djann and comes up with his now patented shove and plug move. Meanwhile, Nobody has won the Kumite and Boomer has stabilized Akbar. Drexel has moved in and he starts harshing on the side of Nobody’s head with the flat of his blade. He gets a lightning bolt or 2 for his trouble (Nobody is a pro at the old duck and weave), but eventually hard steel prevails and Nobody is unconscious as well.
</p>
 
<p>Drexel and Valin start dragging the Djann body, Valin, and Akbar out of the mist cave and back to the last cleared room they were in. Boomer explains that the mist is affecting them like a poison and once they aren’t breathing it they should be ok. Meanwhile, Sallah is still looking into the statues, and has noticed that every once in a while they seem to talk in the voice of the dead Djann and say things like “Power of wish revoked” and Davashunne betrayor”. Something more is going on here. Meanwhile, a hamster sized Persian cat has crawled out of the small hole at the top of the staff Nobody had taken off the dead Djann. It starts floating around like it was picked up by the scruff of its neck by an invisible hand, and it picks up the staff and floats toward the room the rest of the bodies have been taken. Boomer and Sallah were going to go investigate this, but the statues talk in the Djanns voice again. This time they say “Ahriman seeks wish abuse.” And “DIVS… SHILED YOUR EYES!!!”. After that, Sallah spots what looks like a cloaked humanoid figure approaching through the mist.
</p>
 
<p>The minicat has taken the staff and put in on Nobody’s unconscious body. Valin and Drexel move back into the mist room as the cloaked figure gets closer. Sallah tries to talk to it, as it gets close enough to be seen through the mist the party sees it is a horrible creature with nasty claws and a single evil eye surrounded by fangs. Sallah immediately recognizes it as a div and warns the party of its resistances and DR. Then he remembers the gaze attack… TO LATE! The evil eye stuns Sallah and he drops his weapon. Boomer also succumbs to the stunning gaze.
</p>
 
<p>Drexel is far enough away that the mist is blocking the gaze attack, and through the concealment of the mist he manages to start getting arrow shots off at the thing drawing first blood. Valin’s toughness fights off the stunning feeling, and he rushes up to start swinging ax and sword at the beast. It staggers back from his attacks and tries to affect his mind with a spell, but Valin shakes that off as well and presses the attack. Sallah and boomer remain stunned and more arrows fly, one looking to go right into the fang covered eye but the mist can be deceiving and the shot goes wide (crit missed due to concealment). The thing steps back again to try to cast a spell, and again fails. But this step put boomer out range of the gaze. Coming to, he covers his eyes and runs up to shield Sallah’s eyes with his shield. Sallah comes to and picks up his ball and chain. Drexel fires again, and this time the mist does not deceive him. The arrow goes right into the eye of the beast and he wails in pain. Still the gaze goes on though, and finally Valin succumbs to the creatures will. It jumps at the opportunity to full attack a stunned Valin, and claws him viciously. Sallah’s meteor hammer flies in , but goes wide. Then, Valin comes to, dodges and AOO as he picks up his ax, and brings it down on the evil eye splattering it into goo.
</p>
 
<p>At this point everyone retreats into the cathedral chamber and heals up. Akbar and Nobody are now ok, and Boomer uses his speak with animals spell to talk to the little hamster cat. They find out the dead Djann was Dunyizad, one of the Templars. She had come here to warn Vardishai about some sort of betrayal by the Djann Davashunn and to find her successor. The tiny cats name is Mooshqit, and it was Dunyizad’s familiar… but now it will serve Nobody. The cat doesn’t know a ton, because it can’t speak common and could only learn what it saw or what Dunyizad told it directly.
</p>
 
<p>After healing up the party moves through the statue hallway again. Sallah and Akbar are intrigued by the messages from Dunyizad that are coming through the statues. So they pass through the hallway many times until they are sure they have heard them all. Meanwhile, the rest of the party moves through a ruined scroll library and into a small room with a wooden sphinx it is that appears to have once been animated but is now just a statue. In this room, they are attacked by choakers. Valin makes quick work of the first one, and Nobody and Drexel blast the second one off the ceiling. The third one manages to get a hold of Valin’s neck, but is splattered by the rest of the crew before it can do any real damage. During the fight, Boomer pulls out a crossbow to show off how bad he is at using weapons, and Akbar is still distracted by the statues (and smoking) and right before the last choaker is killed the party hears him yelling from the next room over “Hey guys, I’m in the room!”
</p>
 
<p>During their hallway runs, Sallah and Akbar heard the following:</p>
 
<p>“Power of wish revoked”</p>
<p>“Templars divided”</p>
<p>“Davashunn betrayor!”</p>
<p>“Seeking kakishone”</p>
<p>“Creeper found spooky… Astral projection”</p>
<p>“Helping Efreets”</p>
<p>“Warn Vardishai”</p>
<p>“Mist confusion lycanthropy…. Lost control”</p>
<p>“Ahriman seeks wish abuse”</p>
<p>“DIVS… SHIELD YOUR EYES!”</p>
 
<p>After clearing out this last room, the party heads upstairs and settles into a spot where they can look down on kelemerene, and they watch it for a few hours and eat some lunch and listen to a story about kakishone told by Sallah (see attached). They spot 2 locations where it looks like Gnolls are stationed watching the city, and see smoke coming from the chimney of one of the 2 buildings on the shrine side of the river. They ten see a party of 4 gnolls drag what looks to be a humanoid prisoner (someone they didn’t recognize and not from Almah’s party) get dragged out in front of the battel market and get eviscerated by cackling gnolls, who leave the body there and then go back inside.</p>
 
<p>End.</p>

<h2>LoF 8 - 10/17/2016<br>The Scoutening and Rescue of the Nag</h2>

<p>The party sent Valin back to camp to let Almah know they were going to loop around the north end of Kelmarene and check out the city after nightfall. They wouldn’t get a good view or be able to help the Lions of Fatar as they entered the pesh field, but they figured they would get a good look at what happens in the city when they attacked, and see the city up close after sunset.
</p>
 <p>The trip was uneventful, except for noting that Gnolls have been coming and going along the river north of the city every few days. The party suspects there is communication happening between the town and the old fort up north.
 </p>
 <p>From their vantage point above the city to the north, the party noted that there was another guard post on top of a building on the west side of the battle market. They also saw a patrol of about 8 gnolls moving around the streets of the city. Not much more was spotted until nightfall.  At dusk, a small sized flying creature came out of a building on the east bank of the river. It circled the town a few times, then crawled into an upper window of the battle market. After a few minutes, it crawled back out and went to sit on the battle market roof. The gnoll patrol moved into one of the buildings that had a watch above it, and a fresh patrol unit came out to take their place. Still no one had touched the eviscerated body, which Drexel found odd because usually the gnoll would eat a victim like that.</p>
 
 <p>As darkness settled over the city, a second patrol of 8 gnolls left the battle market. This patrol appeared to be thoroughly looking in the abandoned buildings, as if they were looking for someone. Lastly, a large creature emerged from a building to the south, let out an unnerving bleating screech, when up and ate the eviscerated body, then started walking the streets.</p>
 
 <p>After all this watching, one other thing they noted is that all the patrols seem to avoid the old church on the west side of town.</p>
 
 <p>The party thought long and hard about moving in on the building the flying creature had come out of, to ambush it when it returned home in the morning. But ultimately, they decided they couldn’t move in without Boomer having his spells and without Almah and her crew knowing what they were doing. So they retreated back the way they had came to the temple, and from there back to the monastery to report in with Almah.</p>
 
 <p>Upon arriving at camp it was still night time. Valin emerged from Almah’s quarters and explained he couldn’t get his curse lifted till morning. The Sand Lions were there drinking, celebrating their victory over a large burrowing creature in the pesh field that the party identified from the description as a dust digger. It had tried to swallow Kazzim, which was a mistake. Kazzim had brought the creature tongue back to camp as proof. The party brought Almah and Garavel to gether with the sand lions and started discussing their plans to infiltrate the buildings on the east side of the river or maybe the church. The party was split on whether or not the church holds something horrible that the gnolls are avoiding, or something that could help them against these evil creatures.</p>
 
<p>About that time, Sarah (one of the sand lions) who had been on watch alerted the group that there was motion in the pesh field. It appeared that a patrol of gnolls had entered the field to see what had been going on out there (having spotted the commotion of the sand lions battle earlier in the night). They were prodding a humanoid captive about 20ft in front of the them as they moved through the field. The party decided to go take the patrol out, and the and lions were going to go too…. But Almah said the lions needed to stay put in case the party got captured. They settled on just taking Fatah with them to show them where the dust diggers corpse is at so they could set up an ambush.</p>
 
<p>Tey found the corpse, covered it in a fog cloud, and put dancing lights in it. Everyone except Still and Drexel hid in the fog cloud, with still and Drexel crouching in the pesh 50 ft back to come up behind the gnoll party. Although not seen, things went a little south when a gnoll randomly almost stepped on Drexel in his hiding spot. The 3 gnoll fighters, their leader, and the old gnome woman prisoner were caught in the pinch, but the 4 gnoll archers had Drexel and Still at close range.</p>
 
 
<p>A fight broke out, with Drexel’s first shots going wide. Still popped up out of nowhere and took an archer’s trachea out then disappeared. Valin charged out of the mist toward the leader, but the leader responded with an ax swipe that almost brained Valin through his helmet. Boomer started moving around his lights to get everyone the sight they needed, and made it look like a crazy orc to unaffectedly try to draw fire or scare some dudes off. Valin raged out and started slowly working the leader. She was hard to hit but Valin was making progress. Gnolls started coming at Drexel from all directions, getting up in his face with axes making it hard for him to get a shot off without opening him up to attacks. He stuck with his bow, hoping to dodge all the axes coming at him and take gnolls out quickly. The first arrow bounced off a breastplate, but the second went in through the eye of the gnoll standing next to him and left through the back of the skull dragging brains with it. Akbar got the gnoll leader to drop her ax, and Valin kept up the assault. The b!tch responded with claws and teeth, putting Valin dangerously close to unconsciousness. But the enraged ranger would not back down and his sword and ax kept coming, finally hacking the leader down. Still continued to work his way through to archers, trying to get to Drexel. His curved blades found blood at every turn, but without the sneak damage the work took longer than he wanted. Drexel was again surrounded. He got another round of arrows off, but this time he couldn’t drop a gnoll. The axes came down on him from 2 direction and Drexel fell to the ground bleeding out.</p>
 
<p>Quickly, Boomer rushed forward and stabilized him as Akbar shifted attention to the ones surrounding Drexel, making their weapons burn in their hands. Fatah danced around the battle, but was having a hard time connecting with her fists and she seemed distracted and kept forgetting to attack : ) With only 2 gnolls left, Valin un-raged and focused on healing himself as still stepped in to cut down the gnoll with the burnt hands. Only one gnoll was left, and for a second it stood their with its ax staring still down…. But ultimately it decided to break and run. Still gave chase, pausing to hit the creature with a cloud of poison that froze it in place of a second. Boomer rushed over to start healing Drexel as Still drew blood from the last gnoll but failed to gut the thing before it started running again. Still continued to give chase and threw stars at it, but they went wide. Valin pulled a bow and took a shot, but the moving target proved difficult to hit. Boomer had finally gotten Drexel conscious. The gnoll hunter jumped to his feet and immediately launched an arrow that tool the last gnoll in the back of the neck.</p>
 
<p>Quickly the party gathered the gnolls loot and untied the gnome prisoner. Boomer cautioned against ungagging her, climbing all old gnoll women do is nag nag nag. The old woman looked skeptically at the group who had saved her. The unbound her and removed her gag and immediately she came forth with questions about who they were and where they came from. Boomer said he tried to warn them. Akbar introduced himself, and the gnome woman said she had a message for him. The captain of the sunset ship, which had brought her and her party over from Absolom, had asked her that if she ever ran into a man named Akbar matching his description to just let him and his brother know that she is alive and doing well. Deciding this is no place to talk, Still helps the woman up so they can get going. The woman smacks his hand away explaining that she can walk. Boomer rolls his eyes as still gives her a surprised and harsh look. She says her name is Yoxferd, but she is tight lipped about any further information until she meets Almah.</p>
 
<p>Once she no longer feels that her situation may have gone from bad to worse, Yoxferd opens up. She explains that she was with a party of pathfinders who had come here to investigate the abandond church of Sarenrae (that the party is now camping in). They too had found the corrupt holy symbols of Adbar here, and determined that the church of Adbar in Kelmarene must have had something to do with it. As they approached town, they saw no sight of the gnolls until it was to late. The gnolls ambushed them, and their cleric was the first to fall. Her party would have been able to fight free, but one of the gnolls blew a horn and a large goat like demon came running to join the fight. The creature swung a visious halberd and cut their wizard in two. It appears to have an affinity for killing casters. The gnolls managed to thake the remaining 4 of them alive. This included their fighter, which was recently eviscerated outside the battle market, their bard Felliped who escaped a few days ago and was supposed to go get help, and their guide… a eukage elf woman named Angelie. To this, Drexel’s pointed ears perk up. This woman is his cousin, she is supposedly hot and very good with her swords.</p>
 
<p>Yoxferd explains that she is a alchemist, specializing in the making of bombs. She has been captive for a few weeks. She assumes Angalie is still ok because she as of yet has not been bested on the battle stage in the market. The party asks about the flying creature. The only one Yoxferd has seen is a Harpy who hangs around with the gnoll leader now and then. She doesn’t know whats in the church, her party was taken out before they go there. There are other non-gnolls in the market too. Human who were allowed to come in and set up shop. She doesn’t know how they got in without being attacked, but it appears the gnoll leader does want trade business to be established in the market. Their leader is not a gnoll thought. He is a Djann with a wicked bow that the gnolls call Carjain.</p>
 
<p>With that, Yoxferd says she will do all she can to help kill these gnolls who murdered her companions. She is shown to the alchemical lab and she gets to work making items from what little material there is there. The party settles in to plan their attack.</p>

<h2>LoF 9 - 10-27-2016 <br>Keeping What's Yours and the Roll in of the Wrecking Crew</h2>

<p>After some discussion of scouting out the east buildings the next night, the party finally lays down for rest after a long day. In the pre-dawn light, the party is awakened by a braying howl. Looking out across the pesh field to Kelmarene, they see a lone Gnoll standing on the roof of the battle market, facing towards pale mountain in the distance. Its head is bent down toward the earth, howling an eerie hyena like howl. Sallah’s familiarity with languages tells the group that it is some sort of all clear call. Soon a similar howl can be heard further up into the peaks, in the area of the old fort, then a another reposnse even further off out in the brazen peaks, then a another, and another, and another. The Gnoll atop the battle market starts braying again, making it hard to count the exact number of responces, but there are many echoing off the peaks. Drexel, with his gnoll knowledge, can tell the call is being sent to some sort of pack master, but doesn’t know who. Almah mentions that the same calls were heard 10 days ago when they were just arriving in the area. Dashki steps from the shadows of the hall, peering off at the distant mountain…. “It is the call of the carrion king.” He says, the words dripping with disgust.</p>

<p>Sallah pipes in. He adds that he has heard of this carrion king. Huge gnoll, very strong. They say he was the first gnoll to start worshiping Rovagug instead of Lamashtu. He has been growing in power these past decades. Dashki adds that the carrion king gains power not because of his worship of Rovagug, but because he has unlocked the power of making the unchosen. Surgically altered gnolls who grow to an immense size and strength.</p>

<p>Sallah listens to the braying for a bit longer, his is a little more at ease when he can tell that all of the calls are coming from the mountains in front of them, and there are none from the desert behind. It is about this time that people realize that Still is not here. Sallah brushes that off, says that Still told him that he was going to go do some scouting and that he would meet up with the team later. The braying stops, and everyone goes back to sleep. They plan to rest till noon or 1 and then head toward Kelmarene at sundown. </p>

<p>Noon comes, everyone wakes up, and there is still no Still. Almah gets a bit nervous about the plan. She urges that the party head to the church first, because if Still is scouting the east buildings we could spring the trap to early. The party begrudgingly agrees that they will hit the church first, and if all goes well circle wide around town and come in towards the east buildings closer to dawn. The Sand lions will go with them to the church but hang back, so that they can rush in if needed and Cubby can shoot a signal into the air if an all out assault starts. Nobody and Ackbar decide to head to the east side of town and hang way back, and Nobody will give the signal if an all out attack starts on that end of town.</p>

<p>Planning is interrupted when Fatah, who is on watch, calls everyone to the open hall. See peeks around the wall and looks to the sky pointing. Everyone takes a peak. High above the monastery it appears a very large bird is circling. Breifly, the party thinks the harpy has spotted them, but as the bird lowers they see it is too big to be a harpy and it looks vulture like. Suddenly it dawns on them. Mama has come home for her eggs! Everyone rushes to the open courtyard border and hides by an entry waiting for it to land. They instruct Kazzim to try to get a hold of the bird so that if it is wounded it won’t fly away and give up their location. It would be better if it never leaves. The bird land and the trap is sprung. The fight goes quickly with so many swords, axes, steel balls, fists and arrows coming at it from all directions. Drexel finishes it off with an arrow in the mouth as it starts to screech.  The party waits for night fall.</p>

<p>With the help of the lions dark vision and Drexels low light eyes, the party approaches the church from the west creeping low up a hillside that appears to be capped by crumbling pillars. Most of the lions hang back as planned, but the party decides to take the monk twins with them since they are the quietest of the bunch. AS they crest the hill, they see that the pillars are the outer ring of an old graveyard. Beyond the graveyard a domed cathedral of Adbar looms large.  The thick wood doors are broken, bits still hanging from the hinges and beyond them is a short hallway leading to the cathedrals dark interior. In the center of the graveyard there is a large statue of Adbar, his hands raised and facing toward the city in a welcoming gesture. In front of the statue, a man kneels in the dirt paying homage to the god of cities.</p>

<p>The party approaches cautiously with weapons drawn. As they get near the man, still kneeling in front of the statue, says “Welcome travelers…” His head turns toward the party revealing the grotesque skeletal visage… “to my church.” (cue creepy music for Halloween session).</p>

<p>The party rushes in weapons swinging and quickly surround the creature and start whailing. Each blow of ax, sword, and meteor hammer crunches bone or clangs off his breastplate. Drexels arrows fly true and start to line the creatures spine like acupuncture needles. He takes a swing at Valan, his pole arm draws blood, but it is merely a flesh wound. Zombies start to emerge from the 5 graves in front of the statue, but the wrecking crew is unfazed. An arrow flies in a knocks a neck vertebrae askew (crit!), and Valin uses the new tilt of the head to smack that skull out of the park with his ax. The Zombies are all beheaded before they even take their first steps. The party loots the body and heads into the church.</p>

<p>Inside is a real horror show. The walls of the church are soot covered from a large fire and corpses are everywhere. Taking in the scene, the party can tell that some of them were clerics of adbar, and some were just ordinary citizens with pitch forks and shovels. It appears that they fought a battle here against soldiers, who have also left their dead among the pile of corpses. The soldiers all wear the red metal of the pact master guard.</p>

<p>After a quick scan for magic (there is none) the party moves through the catherdral to the only other exit of the room, a stairway leading down behind the alter is cast in a dull red glow. At the bottom of the stairs, a reinforced stout oak door has a strange fist sized rune etched at its center. The rune is not the symbol of adbar or the div or any symbol the party can recognize. It radiates strong magic and glows with a deep red light. The party backs away and Sallah tries open/close on the door. It has no effect. They decide they have done enough here for now and leave the same way they came continuing with the wrap around plan to the east building, leaving Cubby, Hammad, and Kazzim to watch the church from a safe distance till dawn.</p>

<p>Coming wide around the city to the east side, they meet up with Akbar and Nobody. There is still no sign of still and the 2 buildings east of the river have been quiet all night. Smoke still rises from the one and the flying creature left at night fall and headed into the battle market and then did its areal patrol and went back to the battle market as normal. Still no sign of Still. Ther party decides not to wait any longer, and the then creep in on the harpy building.</p>

<p>As they get up close they peer in the windows, there is nothing inside but hay.. as if an animal has been sleeping in the building. They come around front to sneak in, and that’s when they hear the song. It’s coming from the building with the smoke rising from it, which is exactly where Sallah is heading because he has been captivated!!! The party turns and draws as the harpy walks form the door and takes to the air above the building. Sallah starts walking her way as Valin and Drexel pull bows and start firing. The arrows are very effective. The two monks try the grab a hold of Sallah to stop him, and one succeeds by getting his attention and flashing him. The harpy drops back down into the building, not wanting to take any more arrow fire. Valin rushes up and tries the window shutters…. Locked. Drexel rushes around the other side of the building. He makes the door just as Valin smashed through the shutter on the other side with his ax. One of the monks rushes into the room and straight punches the harpy in her jaw. Drexel plugs her with another arrow. She stops singing, and holds up her hands. “Wait” she says…. “I can help y..” Her sentence is cut short as she looks down at the ax head that just erupted from her chest. Valin made it through the window. </p>

<p>She falls to the ground and looks up at Valin…”You were beautiful” she whispers and she reaches up to Valin’s face as she dies.</p>

<h2>LoF 10 - 11/14/2016 <br> The Stealthening and Rescue of the Horn and Cap</h2>

<p>It is a few hours till dawn and 2 gnolls are spotted approaching the bridge, most likely drawn by the sounds of songs and axes smashing windows. Akbar and Boomer have also rushed in from the hill to aid in combat with the Harpy… but arrived too late. The party hasn’t yet been spotted,  and are wishing Still was with them. Suddenly one of the gnolls on the bridge grabs his neck and falls to the ground. Still appears from the shadows with swords drawn rushing at the second Gnoll. Boomer quickly tosses a zone of silence on the area, and he does so just in time as the second gnoll brings a horn to his mouth. It blows it to no avail as an arrow from Valin sticks into his shoulder and two arrows from Drexel click off the stones at his feet. Sallah rushes toward the bridge, steathfully avoiding line of sight from the nearby watch tower as Akbar moves to the cover of the nearby building. Drexel loops around the building and finds an open window as Still drops the last gnoll.</p>

<p>Drexel jumps into the building and opens the barred front door for Akbar, Valin, and boomer do a quick search on the building (a magic short sword is found) while Sallah and Still drag/weekend at bernies the gnoll bodies behind the nearby wall of a ruined building. Still explains to Sallah that he has seen Felliped the pathfinder bard who escaped from the gnolls, and wants to go get him before they leave the place. Sallah  agrees that getting him out would be good, and he goes back across the bridge as stealthfully as he can and explains what still is doing and helps search the building… finding a magic ring. Boomer puts darkness on Drexel so he can help get this Felliped across the bridge without being seen, and Drexel crosses the bridge as Still sneaks into the building that he saw Felliped emerge from earlier in the night. After a bit of searching he finds the guy in a hidy hole below the false bottom of a wardrobe. After avoiding a spear thrust he explains that he is here to rescue him and they close up the hidey hole, pour a foul smelling substance on themselves at Felliped’s urging, and head out the window together.</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, Drexel in his cloud of darkness has made his way to the window. He almost gave up their position when peaking in a window to see what the pig sounds he heard were… and realizing that the dire boars inside the stable have the scent ability. Drexel manages to sneak out of scent range and meet up with the other 2, and he gets some nasty liquid as well to cover his scent. They would learn later that it is gnoll piss that Felliped has collected from chamber pots to avoid detection from the boars.</p>

<p>
The 3 of them sneak back across the bridge and join the rest of the team. Plan is to wait until morning for what they now know is a peryton (thanks to felliped) to come back to its nest at dawn. However, they realize that they would really like the horn from that gnoll corpse, and they would prefer the gnoll corpses to be dumped in the river, so Still volunteers to sneak back.</p>

<p>He makes it back to the corpses without being detected, and he manages to collect the horn and the rest of their gear and ditch their bodies in the river. Unfortunately, just as he was about to make it back to the cover of the peryton’s building he was finally spotted by a guard on the watch tower. The alarm is raised and the party decides to run. They high tail it up the hill and disappear into the darkness.</p>

<p>They take a long loop back to the Monastery and get there by dawn. They explain the situation to Almah and crew, and get as much info from Felliped about the battle market and its inhabitance (see map). They learn that this leader, Gyarrgaagn or something like that, enjoys watching people fight on the battle stage in the center of the market. He watched from his throne 3 stories up, and has a clear shot to the stage from there with his bow that he is quite good at using. With him is the gnoll commander, who is a large and vicious flind biotch, and usually Undrella the harpy but I guess she won’t be hanging out there anymore. There is an Ogre known as the strangler that use to be the battle stage champion until Angaleh showed up and beat him. Besides that, there are probably 3 dozen gnolls inside the market, some half orc, human, and bugbear merchants who have taken up residence, and a goblin servant.</p>

<p>Anyway, after this info dump the party orders some bombs from Molly O. and takes a nap. The next day they try unsuccessfully to lure the demon out of the city with the horn and they find that the number of watchers in the ruined buildings around the city has increased. They abandon this plan and head back to the peryton building via a very long loop around and once night falls they try to sneak back in there using a darkenss spell. They see that the bridge now has 8 gnoll guards on it, and those guards hear Akbar as he trys the door to the peryton building inside the darkness (and finds it has been re-barred). The gnolls start shooting arrows into the darkness, Drexel returns fire and Valin steps out of the darkness to return fire as others buff/prep for a fight. The gnolls all shoot at the exposed Valin as an invisible still rapidly approaches them holding a lot of bombs.</p>

<h2>LoF 11 - 11/21/2016 <br> The Burnanating and Death of a Goat Thing</h2>

<p>Still rolls in invisibly and lights the bridge up. All the gnoll archers on the bridge die and the big tower shield guys seem unhappy as everyone else gets some buffs going and starting working their way forward. Gnolls appear in many windows and arrows start coming from all over. Drexel ineffectively returns fire into windows as Valin and Sallah work their way forward to support Still and they all start swinging at bridge dudes. The bridge dudes are tough and they stand firm. Boomer continues to move in as fast as his little legs will take him and Akbar does some magic that isn’t effective. The bridge dudes throw javelins at Valin, they all bounce off his shiny breastplate. The guy closest to him draws and ax and takes a chunk. He is followed by a rain of arrows from the nearby buildings and Valin’s luck runs out. He’s down and bleeding out. Sallah trips the ax dude and dances through to the other side of the bridge to set a flank up.</p>

<p>Boomer gets to the bridge and he and Akbar get to healing while Still uses the flank from Sallah to take the tripped dude out. At this point Still notices other gnolls watching from around the corner of a few buildings. They seem to be waiting for something. Drexel continues his poor display of archery, but does manage to get a little bop in here and there. Valin is up, and he stands and starts swinging at the next front man with Sallah and Still, but the tower shield is hard to penetrate. The goat demon appears and is running fast toward the bridge. All the gnolls except the one in melee get out of his way. The melee fighter takes a last wild swing at Valin… it’s a crit! Valin eats dirt again and boomer continues to heal as Akbar puts up a bunch of cloud cover to protect the party from all the archers in the windows. Drexel moves into position to have a clear shot at the demon as everyone starts contemplating retreat. The demon charges in a Sallah, but he misses. Sallah connects with a swing for a bit of damage. Drexels arrows fly in, but they can’t get through the DR. Valin is back on his feet, and he takes a bite out of the demon with his ax as boomer keeps the heals coming and akbar puts up a second smoke screen. Everyone starts to try to draw the demon back, but Sallah can’t move because of his attack. The demon comes at him again… and misses again!</p>

<p>With the screen up the arrow fire has halted, Drexel can’t do anything with his arrows and more gnolls have shown up at the end of the street. There is a lot of debate about running while they can, but the finish the job we came here for crew led by the call for action from boomer wins through. Still warps himself behind the demon and gets a sneak attack off with the aid of Sallah’s chain. His strange eastern blade cuts deep into the demons exposed flank and foul smelling ichor sprays out (almost all 6s on a lot of six siders, incredible roll). The demon is destroyed!!!! (and the body vanishes like destroyed summon demons are known to do).</p>

<p>The gnolls are pissed. They let out the war pigs and a gnoll comes around a corner with a pack of hyena’s on leashes! The pigs charge in and the front one connects for some painful goring. The party starts a fighting retreat. Arrows from Drexel seem better equipped to stick pigs, and Valin’s as and sword find pig flesh soft and squishy. The party manages to drop one the the pigs before fading into the brush to run.</p>

<p>The pigs and hyenas give chase for a bit, but eventually are called back. The party makes it back to camp to rest and tell their tale.</p>

<p>Just before dawn, a group of gnolls are seen approaching the monastery from the direction of the temple. Everyone gets into defensive positions and ready for a fight, but suddenly Dashki jumps in front of everyone waiving his hands and telling the party not to attack. He says it is Gnolls of the three jaw clan, and they are here to help.</p>
